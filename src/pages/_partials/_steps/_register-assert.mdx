Memfault can automatically capture crash information on asserts by calling
`MEMFAULT_ASSERT()` from your platforms assert handler:

```c
#include "memfault/panics/assert.h"

#define YOUR_PLATFORM_ASSERT(x) MEMFAULT_ASSERT(x)
```

### Newlib C library assert.h

If your platform is using the `assert()` or `abort()` calls directly from a libc
implementation, you should override the implementations to call
`MEMFAULT_ASSERT`.

To accomplish this with Newlib C library (bundled as the default with most
compilers), we recommend adding the following to a C File in your project:

```c
//! @file assert_overrides.c

#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void __assert_func(const char *file, int line,
                   const char *func, const char *failedexpr) {
   MEMFAULT_ASSERT(0);
}

void _exit(int status) {
   MEMFAULT_ASSERT(0);
}
```

:::tip

Memfault advises **against** calling `assert()` directly from a project.
Instead, we suggest adding a `YOUR_PLATFORM_ASSERT(x)` macro as described above
instead. Benefits include:

- making it easier to swap out behavior for different environments such as
  compile code for a unit test versus a real target.
- leading to substantial code space savings by enabling the removal of assert
  conditions passed via the `failedexpr` arg.

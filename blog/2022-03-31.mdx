## Improved Device Search

Memfault
[organizes your data](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#organizing-devices-within-a-project)
around the concept of _devices_. An investigative
[search for matching devices](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/metrics#searching-devices-by-attributes-and-timeseries)
is a key activity when analyzing data around device attributes and time-series
metrics. Memfault’s device search also acts as a hub when clicking on details on
charts, OTA management, or as part of crash analysis. It allows you to precisely
describe a population of devices before performing follow-up tasks such as
assigning them to a specific Cohort or describing a new Device Set.

We made significant improvements to the device search! Most fields now accept
multiple values (”OR”) and can be repeated where applicable (”AND”). You can
search for device attributes and time-series data at the same time and it is
even possible to search for historical data across different time ranges at
once.

When combined, you can now conveniently describe (and store as
[Device Set](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#device-sets))
populations such as

- “Devices on v1.2 that were charged >90% earlier this week but rebooted due to
  low power yesterday” – to **validate presumed bug fixes via operational
  data**, or
- “Devices with attributes `was_reworked`: `true`, `shipment_state`:
  `"back to us"` and `assignee`: `"John"`” – to use
  [custom device attributes](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/metrics#attributes)
  for **inventory management**

## General

- Added:
  [Memfault example for ESP32 Wrover kit](https://github.com/memfault/amazon-freertos-esp32-example),
  based on Amazon FreeRTOS SDK
- Improved: Device Search (see highlight section above)
- Improved:
  [Memfault CLI tool to 0.6.5](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/#history)
  (added support for Qualcomm audio ELFs, and improved validation checks)
- Improved: Qualcomm globals view + support for Audio ELF and logs
- Improved: Performance for MCU globals view + support for
  [compressed elf sections](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/dealing-with-large-symbol-files)
- Improved: Navigation between various pages (reboots to timeline, various
  charts to device search, MCU queue analyzer opens memory view, version matrix
  to search, navigation to delta releases)
- Improved: Metric picker component (search, alerts, charts) only presents
  compatible metrics and provides a matching value editor (numeric, string,
  boolean)
- Improved: Device Set charts distinguish between “no past data” and zero values
- Improved: Built-in metrics for Android Bort Client/Server system
- Fixed: Several UI quirks (names in Version Matrix, axis labels on version
  charts, occasionally overlapping labels in charts, occasional flicker on
  charts, occasionally covered popovers in charts, scrollbar jumping on some
  pages)
- Fixed: Stale data (required browser refresh) when moving devices to another
  cohort
- Fixed: Parsing of several edge cases for MCU coredumps and Android bug reports
- Fixed: Button “Download Binary” (for traces and coredumps) on Chrome
- Fixed: Too frequently required SSO Login
- Changed: Now enforcing maximum file size of 300MB for symbol file
- Removed: Stale historical data according to retention policy
- Removed: Ability to navigate from column summary cells in Version Matrix to
  Device Search

## MCU SDK

In March,
[SDK version 0.29.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0291-and-sdk-0290---mar-16-2022)
was released:

- [Memfault Diagnostic GATT Service (MDS)](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/include/memfault/ports/ble/mds.h)
  to transparently forward data collected by the SDK to a Bluetooth Low Energy
  gateway and proxied to the cloud (more soon)
- improved stability of Mbed OS invoke commands
- Breaking Change: If your project is based on Zephyr < 2.6, you now need to
  explicitly set `CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT=y` in your `prj.conf`

## Android SDK

We have not published a new version of the
[Android Bort AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) in March.

### Memfault OTA for Embedded Linux

Memfault‚Äôs over-the-air update service is now
[available on Embedded Linux with SWUpdate](/docs/linux/ota) via the
[hawkBit DDI](/docs/linux/memfault-hawkbit-comparison). This makes all Memfault
OTA management and hosting features such as cohorts, staged rollouts, full vs.
delta releases, and a scalable global CDN available to Linux devices that
utilize one of the most popular update agents. Memfault also added support for
forced (non-interactive) updates ‚Äì invaluable for delivering security updates to
embedded IoT devices.

To communicate with SWUpdate clients,
[Memfault acts as a hawkBit update server](/docs/linux/memfault-hawkbit-comparison).
It implements the Direct Device Integration API enabling other on-device agents
such as [RAUC (via hawkBit client)](https://github.com/rauc/rauc-hawkbit) to
deliver and install software remotely as well.

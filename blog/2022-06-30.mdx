## Normalized Charts

[Memfault’s charts can now be normalized](/docs/platform/charts#chart-normalization)
to convert absolute values such as “number of incidents”, sums, and counts to
corresponding relative values “per 1,000 devices". This helps in understanding
real trends when you are looking at values over time or when comparing values
between populations of different sizes.

This feature also works with custom metric charts for any custom metric. It is
particularly helpful to measure the success of an ongoing OTA update by
comparing devices from large production cohort “Default” against those from a
smaller test cohort “Beta”. Chart normalization is also generally useful when
the population size changes over time (e.g. new devices being activated
continuously).

## Notification Targets

Memfault improved its
[notification system and how notifications will be sent](/docs/platform/notifications)
on [Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts). For each individual Alert, you can now
decide which team members, external systems, or groups thereof should receive an
email. All members of `@team-maintenance` may want to receive notifications
about devices with an abnormal battery discharge rate while a spike in
connectivity issues on the “Beta” cohort may only be relevant in the
`#beta-release` Slack channel.

At
[Settings → Notifications](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/notifications),
there are extensive options to customize the `@userhandle` for any team member
to connect Memfault to dedicated Slack channels or any other external system
(e.g. PagerDuty, Opsgenie) by registering external email addresses. Any
combination of these
[User Handles and External Targets can be added to a Notification Group](/docs/platform/notifications#group-targets)
and used to control how to notify per Alert.

  [Documentation of Bort’s automatically collected built-in metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics)
- Fixed: Mini charts for “number of bug reports” on device details page not
  visible
- No new version of
  the [Android Bort AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) was released in
  June, but there is a noteworthy improvement on the
  [4.2-RC1 branch](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/4.2-RC1):
  - Added: Support for non-interactive OTA installations via build settings +
    via SDK settings

## Linux

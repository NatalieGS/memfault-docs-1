## Tracking Battery Life Best Practices

## Debug Devices with Custom Data Recordings

[Memfault’s new Custom Data Recordings (CDRs)](/docs/platform/inspecting-a-device#custom-data-recordings)
allow devices to send any custom data for specific events or periods at
arbitrary times. Memfault’s Device Timeline shows these recordings grouped by
their user-defined reason in relation to the existing debug information, such as
metrics, logs, traces, or reboots to provide even more detail about the state a
device was in at a given moment.

The underlying data of CDRs can be of any format and is accessible for download
for further analysis outside of Memfault. This allows devices to send
vendor-specific or proprietary debug data from their sub-components. Via the
Memfault CLI, one can also augment the device timeline with data captured
outside of the device (e.g. reports for hardware-in-the-loop tests).

## General

- Added: Onboarding flow for
  [Infineon](https://memfault.com/news/infineon-memfault-partner-improve-iot-development-in-field-iteration-more-reliable-devices/)
  customers
- Added: Sorting of the
  [Settings → Metrics](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/metrics)
  list on Attribute / Timeseries fields
- Improved: UI of the Device Timeline (indication of extrapolated values with
  `locf` label, using “Range” values from
  [Settings → Metrics](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/metrics)
  to fit values into the swimlane, setting viewport of the Device Timeline to
  day boundaries when accessed through a direct link, combination of
  `min/mean/max` values of the same metric into one swimlane under Device
  Timeline, more accessible line colors)
- Improved: Link to the Device Timeline from Log Details page (via Captured
  Date)
- Improved: Various places in UI (Better placement of the system status into the
  side menu, removal of duplicate information text in Archive Software Type
  modal, more explicit OTA version checking explanation text, alignment of the
  log fields in Android and MCU projects, more explicit error message in the
  case of a timeout)
- Improved: Load time of all Issue Occurrence charts
- Fixed: Error when creating project through
  [Particle](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/particle/README.md#memfault-library-for-use-with-particle-device-os)
  registration link
- Fixed: Duplicate project creation modal when registering through a partner URL
- Fixed: “Create Token” button opening SSO connection modal if SSO page was
  visited first
- Fixed: Possible timeout when staging releases on very large cohorts
- Fixed: Possible timeout when searching devices in very large fleets using
  custom attributes
- Fixed: Possible timeout when processing Qualcomm crash reports
- Fixed: Device attributes not populated in projects where Fleet Sampling is
  enabled
- Fixed: Error when loading the dashboard on Safari Mobile
- Fixed: [Alert Notifications](/docs/platform/alerts) not being triggered when
  the metric in alert condition has a “.” in its name

## MCU

- SDK versions
  [0.34.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0340-and-sdk-0335---nov-1-2022),
  [0.34.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0341-and-sdk-0340---nov-7-2022),
  [0.34.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0342-and-sdk-0341---nov-8-2022),
  [0.35.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0350-and-sdk-0342---nov-22-2022)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Experimental
    [Custom Data Recording](/docs/platform/inspecting-a-device/#custom-data-recordings)
    API for sending custom data (modem traces, vendor-specific crash reports,
    etc.)
  - Added: Support for
    [ModusToolbox™️ Software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/)
    3.0
  - Added: Support for [Heap Allocation Tracking](/docs/mcu/heap-stats/) on
    Zephyr port
  - Improved: Zephyr port’s heap stats to only collect during
    allocations/deallocations from threads
  - Improved:
    [Various utility and quality of life improvements](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#chart_with_upwards_trend-improvements-3)
    for
    [ESP32 port](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/ports/esp_idf)
    and
    [example app](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/esp32/apps/memfault_demo_app)

  - Added:
    [Support for setting the reboot reason using the `last_reboot_reason_file`](/docs/linux/reboot-reason-tracking/#the-last_reboot_reason_file-api)

    - Kernel panics showing up in the application as "brown out reset"
    - Collection of multiple reboot events for a single reboot

      installation of an OTA update using
      [SWUpdate](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/swupdate.html)

## Comparison Mode for Metric Charts

Since the introduction of [Custom Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics), Memfault
provided various ways to define charts for plotting fleet-wide aggregations
(sum, count, min, max, mean). These charts are often used to visualize trends
over time (e.g. "hours between recharge") or to detect anomalies (e.g. "attempt
until successful connect") for a subset of the fleet. The controls in the
top-right corner allow for ad-hoc filtering by cohort and/or software version.

With the advent of the
[Chart Comparison Mode](/docs/platform/charts#comparison-mode), users can now
apply up to 4 such filters simultaneously to plot the resulting data series
side-by-side inside each custom chart.

Use this feature to visually compare your beta cohort against the production
fleet or to see at a glance if there are any regressions for key metrics between
the last software versions.

## Linked Devices

Sometimes, products span across multiple devices: Each pair of wireless earplugs
has a left and right version, for each smart home installation there may be
multiple components in a network, or some related device information lives
outside of Memfault, and your workflow benefits from quick navigation to another
software system.

Memfault's Linked Devices provide convenient navigation in these scenarios. It
builds these connections by looking at Device Attributes that can be edited in
the UI, updated via API, or sent from devices at any time.

## MCU Heap Visualization

Memfault can now
[track and visualize heap allocations with any coredump](/docs/mcu/heap-stats)
on a growing number of MCU Architectures starting with ARM Cortex-M, nRF Connect
SDK, ESP32 ESP-IDF, ESP8266, and Dialog DA1469x.

This optional debugging feature tags all heap allocations with their respective
size, address, and location of code that allocated it. Use it to understand
memory distribution, heap fragmentation, or to find memory leaks in an
out-of-memory situation in the field.

## Managing Rate Limits

Memfault's frontend is now more upfront with the visualization of
[quotas and rate limits](/docs/platform/rate-limiting) that may affect large
projects.

When managing
[Timeseries Metrics and Device Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics), Memfault
informs about the number of remaining metrics for fleet-wide analytics. The
dedicated page at Settings→Quotas presents an overview.

## General

- Various UI improvements: Creating new elements in the UI follow a similar flow
  throughout Memfault, places that enumerate software versions consistently use
  their human-readable form, and unexpected errors no longer prevent
  interactions in the frontend.
- The Qualcomm QCC51xx support has received further compatibility improvements
  when processing coredumps (`.xed`/`.xcd`).
- There is now detailed documentation on
  [how Memfault handles ordering of version numbers](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version#ordering)
  and [on Metrics and Device Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics).

## MCU SDK

In November, two SDK versions
[0.27.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0272-and-sdk-0271---nov-5-2021)
and
[0.27.3](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0273-and-sdk-0272---nov-22-2021)
were released. Here are some highlights:

- The Mynewt integration now supports the Memfault demo shell
  via `mflt_shell_init()`, see
  the [Mynewt port README.md](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/mynewt/README.md) for
  details. Huge thanks to [@t3zeng](https://github.com/t3zeng) for providing
  this implementation!
- Add support for ESP-IDF v4.3.1. This update should fix the bootlooping issue
  seen when using the port with v4.3.1+ of ESP-IDF.
- Add support for `LOG2` deferred mode on Zephyr. This should fix bootloops when
  enabling `LOG2`.
- Fix a build error for the Nordic Connect SDK v1.7.99 development version
- Update the esp32 and zephyr examples to use `1.0.0-dev` instead
  of `1.0.0+<6 digits of build id>` for the version specifier. Build id is no
  longer required for symbol file reconciliation and the `+` character is a
  reserved character for URI schemes; this impacted OTA release requests. See
  this document
  for [Memfault's recommended versioning strategy](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version/#software-version)
- Add a reboot reason port for the STM32F7xx family.

## Android SDK

There was no new version of
[the Memfault Android SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) in November.

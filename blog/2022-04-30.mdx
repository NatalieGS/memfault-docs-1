## More Documentation

Memfault’s documentation at [docs.memfault.com](http://docs.memfault.com)
received a new landing page and various other additions.

![Updated Docs](/img/blog/2022-04-30-Updated_Docs.png)

The updated [landing page](https://docs.memfault.com) outlines content across
MCU, Android, and Linux. It also links to additional learning resources such as
video content and source code examples. Other improvements include the new page
[Introduction to Memfault](/docs/platform/introduction), more information on
[Memfault’s Linux Support](/docs/linux/introduction), and many smaller new
sections such as a
[comparison between Android Bug Reports and Caliper](/docs/android/android-bort/#collection-types---bug-reports-and-caliper).

## Improvements on Charts

Memfault surfaces relevant insights about your fleet via charts. They receive
updates regularly to be more comprehensive and useful.

![Improved Charts](/img/blog/2022-04-30-Improved_Charts.gif)

The dashboard chart “Active Devices” was redesigned to be a bar chart to
communicate its underlying data more clearly: “Devices that communicated with
Memfault in a given time period”. Tooltips on several charts better highlight
the numerical values their lines and bars represent. The chart “Reboot Reasons”
also allows for drill-down on any day by clicking on the respective labels.

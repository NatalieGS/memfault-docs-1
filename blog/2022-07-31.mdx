## Linux SDK 0.2.0

Memfault extends its [features on embedded Linux](/docs/linux/introduction)
toward basic fleet operations. You can now measure basic fleet-wide health
metrics by tracking reboots and their cause at scale. Similar to Memfault’s
[MCU](/docs/mcu/introduction) and [Android](/docs/android/introduction) SDKs,
there is now a dedicated
[Memfault Linux SDK 0.2.0 with source code](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk)
including examples. The SDK repository comes with Docker images including QEMU
support to simplify the first steps.

![Documentation, Repository, and Project Wizard for Linux](/img/blog/2022-07-31-Linux-SDK.png)

As part of the SDK, a new on-device agent `memfaultd` orchestrates the
configuration of related components such as SWUpdate for OTA. It will act as a
minimal yet central component in future releases for features such as metrics
and crash reporting.

There is also a new [Getting Started](/docs/linux/linux-getting-started-guide)
section that guides users through the setup with Yocto, and the
[reference documentation](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultd-configuration) covers
more details.

## General

- Added: Entries are now shown under
  [Events Debug](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/events)
  when an invalid serial number is sent
- Improved: Users can opt-out of email for alerts and issues separately via
  [notification preferences](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings)
- Improved: Performance of Device Timeline
- Improved: Various UI elements (Issue List on Device Details, consistent use of
  issue type in lists, next available release of a device)
- Improved: Documentation of
  [alert frequency](/docs/platform/alerts/#notification-frequency) and
  [file upload API endpoints](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#2d08c7d6-fc5e-4fc7-ac77-9d72e58ba7aa)
- Fixed: Visual glitches (chart icons on Safari, truncated tooltips, overlapping
  content in lists)
- Fixed: Error when activating full releases via the Version Matrix
- Fixed: Missing issue reasons on Dashboard
- Fixed: Missing device serial numbers at Issues → Recent Traces
- Fixed: Device search result no longer sorted by last seen
- Fixed: Error when marking a metric as a device attribute when approaching
  quota limits
- Fixed: Error when trying to activate a non-staged release using memfault-cli
- Changed: [Normalized Charts](/docs/platform/charts#chart-normalization) now
  only consider active devices of a given population

## MCU

- Added: Published Python package
  [mflt_compact_log](https://pypi.org/project/mflt-compact-log/) to decode
  Memfault-flavored compact logs
- Added: Published list of
  [contributions](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-ios-cloud/pull/1/files)
  to [memfault-ios-cloud](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-ios-cloud)
- SDK versions
  [0.31.3](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0313-and-sdk-0312---july-8-2022),
  [0.31.4](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0314-and-sdk-0313---july-19-2022)
  and
  [0.31.5](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0315-and-sdk-0314---july-22-2022)
  were released. Some highlights: \*\*\*\*
  - Added: Support for Zephyr v3.1+ by conditionally compiling out Logger v1
    code (and pre-release of nRF Connect SDK v2.0.99 and Zephyr > v3.1)
  - Added: Support for deferring the initializing Memfault SDK to application
    start on ESP32 port with new Kconfig
    option: `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_AUTOMATIC_INIT`
  - Added: Support for initializing Memfault earlier in the system startup for
    diagnosing crashes in an early driver initialization on Zephyr port with new
    Kconfig
    options, `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_INIT_PRIORITY`/`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_INIT_LEVEL_POST_KERNEL`
  - Fixed: Build warnings on NRF Connect SDK + Zephyr v3.1 (partially supported)
  - Fixed: Backtraces for Zephyr `__ASSERT()` macro on aarch32/cortex_m.
  - Fixed: compilation issue in the Dialog example app from the removal
    of `memfault_demo_cli_cmd_print_chunk()` in Memfault SDK release v0.31.4.

## Android

- We did not publish a new version of the
  [Android Bort AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) in July.

## Linux

- Updated: [Introduction page for Embedded Linux](/docs/linux/introduction)
- Added: [Getting Started Guide](/docs/linux/linux-getting-started-guide) and
  Reference pages for
  [memfaultd Configuration](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultd-configuration/) and
  [memfaultd CLI](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultd-cli)
- First
  [public SDK version 0.2.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  following initial 0.1.0 was released. Some highlights:
  - Added: On-device agent `memfaultd`
    - Exhaustive configurability via settings
    - Reporting reboot reasons
    - Orchestrating SWUpdate for OTA
    - Data communication only after user consent
  - Added: Yocto layer for `memfaultd`

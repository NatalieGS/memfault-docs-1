## What is an Issue?

When devices in your fleet upload diagnostics data to Memfault, the data is
analyzed by Memfault. Any detected problems are converted into Traces. Similar
Traces are logically grouped together into an Issue, based on the signature of
the Trace.

In other words, a Trace is a single occurrence of a problem and an Issue is a
group of Traces manifesting the same problem.

## Issue states

An Issue can be in one of these states:

| State      | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unresolved | The Issue has not yet been fixed                                                                                                                                             |
| Resolved   | The Issue has been (considered to be) fixed                                                                                                                                  |
| Merged     | The Issue has been merged into another Issue                                                                                                                                 |
| Muted      | The Issue has not been fixed, but you want to hide it from the list of Unresolved Issues, you do not want to be alerted about it and it should not be automatically reopened |

## Manually changing Issue state

The state of an Issue can be viewed an changed manually from the Issue's detail
page. Navigate to Issues, optionally change the filter criteria. Then click the
title to navigate to the Issue detail page.

Below the title of the Issue, you will find a button to change the state:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/docs/platform/issue-mgmt-resolving-ui.gif"
    alt="/img/docs/platform/issue-mgmt-resolving-ui.gif"
  />
</p>

When the Issue is Unresolved, the button will say "Resolve" and clicking it will
change the state to Resolved.

When the Issue is Resolved or Muted, the button will say "Reopen". When it is
Muted, the button will also have a red outline. Clicking it will change the
state to Unresolved.

To Mute an Issue, click the caret on the right side of the button and click
"Mute".

## Automatic Issue reopening upon regression

When Memfault receives a Trace from a greater Software Version compared to the
last Software Version when the Issue was Resolved, it will automatically be
changed to Unresolved and subscribed users will automatically be notified.

You can also "Mute" an issue if you never want it to reopen and keep it Resolved
indefinitely or until you manually reopen it again.

:::note Example

Issue A is seen on Software Versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. You close Issue A when
1.2 was the greatest Software Version it was seen on. In the future, when a new
Trace is received from Software Version 1.3 for the same Issue, Memfault
automatically reopens it and changes the Issue to Unresolved.

## Monitoring Issue Occurrence

Memfault offers different ways to monitor the occurrence of Issues over time.

To visualize Issue occurrence at the fleet level, you can create
[Issue Charts](/docs/platform/charts#issue-charts). Issue Charts group together
related Issues and allow you to visualize their occurrence over time.

Additionally, you can visualize the occurrence of an Issue over different
Software Versions, Hardware Versions and Cohorts using the distribution
visualization charts present in the **Issue details** view:

## What is a Project, and what is a Fleet?

A **Project** is the umbrella under which Memfault organizes all the data
related to a particular hardware product. Individual **Devices** check in
periodically to the Project via the Memfault API, and the set of all checked-in
Devices is called the **Fleet**.

A Fleet often consists of homogeneous devices, like a certain model of an AC
unit or a games console. Fleets may also consist of different but related
devices, for example left and right wireless earbuds. We recommend keeping
different revisions of the same hardware in the same Project, so that revisions
can be easily compared later.

Within each Memfault Project you can:

- [Monitor Fleet-wide metrics](./charts.mdx)
- [Inspect and debug individual Devices](./inspecting-a-device.mdx)
- Deploy new firmware/software updates to parts of your
  [Android](../android/android-releases-guide.mdx) or
  [MCU](../mcu/releases-guide.mdx) Fleet

### Creating a new Project

You can create a new project in Memfault by navigating to the project selector
in the sidebar. You can find an option to **Create Project** below your list of
existing projects.

TODO: more handholding on the project creation flow, maybe with MCU/Android/Linux tabs.
Probably best to document the "Settings" page (which is basically Project Settings) and
refer to that in the project creation docs, instead of duplicating it.

## Organizing your Fleet

### Cohorts

You can slice your Fleet into mutually exclusive **Cohorts**, for example a
`beta` Cohort and a `production` Cohort. Cohorts are perfect for releasing new
firmware versions to a small test group, before pushing it out to customers.
Cohorts also lend themselves to things like light A/B testing, or deploying
slight variations of the firmware to different Device revisions within a
Project.

:::note

As you may have noticed already, Cohorts are meant to help you deploy the right
software to the right Devices at the right time. Devices can only belong to one
cohort at a time.

### Device Sets

It is often useful to search for devices that fulfill certain criteria and to
keep track of the number of matches over time. Examples of this could be
searching for devices that:

1. have not communicated with Memfault within the last N days,
2. are running a deprecated software version, or
3. are reporting a metric over a critical threshold.

This kind of follow-up can easily be done by defining a **Device Set**, which
will do a daily tally of a search query of your choice, and present it to you in
a graph:

![](/img/docs/platform/device-set-page.png)

As soon as the Device Set is defined, Memfault starts collecting daily tallies.
We store daily tallies for up to 14 days.

Device Sets are not just pretty graphs, you can also get a listing of the
Devices belonging to the Device Set, for further analysis.

:::note

Device Sets are great for getting concrete answers to fleet-wide questions. As
with Cohorts, they are also a great way of categorizing your Fleet, albeit with
more flexibility: a Device can be a member of any number of Device Sets.

:::

#### Creating a Device Set

Device Sets are created from the _Devices_ page. Perform a search, click on the
_Save as Device Set_ button, give the Device Set a name (and optional
description) and you are done! You can view your newly created Device Set on the
_Device Sets_ page.

:::note

Depending on the query, it may take up to a day for the first data to trickle
in.

:::

#### Editing/deleting a Device Set

You can edit the name and the description of the Device Set by clicking the edit
button in the Device Set page. Editing the search query itself is disabled to
preserve comparability with historical data, if you need to change the query,
create a new Device Set.

You can of course also delete a Device Set that no longer interests you.

#### Viewing the Devices currently in a Device Set

Clicking the latest count for a Set in the Device Sets page will take you to the
_Devices_ page, with the appropriate search terms filled in.

#### Interpreting Device Set data

The daily tally corresponds to running the same search query on the Devices page
once per day, at roughly the same time. This provides an excellent large-scale
overview of whatever properties of your fleet you may be interested in, but you
shouldn't rely on the exact number, since the tallying time may vary slightly
from day to day.

Memfault charts allow you to proactively monitor any smart device, anywhere.
Monitor your releases and view data-driven device and fleet-level metrics, like
battery health, connectivity, and more in real-time dashboards.

## Overview Dashboard

The Overview Dashboard offers a selection of charts that provide an outlook of
the state of your fleet at a glance. To open it, go to **Dashboards ->
Overview**.

You can filter the data in the Overview Dashboard by Cohort by selecting one in
the drop-down menu in the top-right corner of the page. You can also toggle the
scope of the data between Weekly and Daily on the top-right corner of each
chart.

### Drilldown

Overview Dashboard charts that have a **Drilldown** badge on them can be clicked
on sections of the chart (and sometimes also on labels) to go to a filtered-down
list of Devices that make up the data for that interval.

## Metric Charts

Memfault indexes and aggregates the metrics collected by your devices to provide
you not only with insights of how individual devices are performing, but also
the emergent behavior of your entire fleet.

You can add charts to visualize these aggregated, fleet-wide metrics by
navigating to the sidebar and selecting **Dashboards** and then **Metrics**.

Creating a new chart is as simple as clicking `Create Chart`, selecting your
metric of interest, and choosing the desired aggregation type. Note that only
metrics [configured as Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be
used in Metric Charts.

</p>

The list of metrics available in your project is automatically created from the
metrics collected by your devices. For that reason, at least one device must
upload data for a given metric before a chart for that metric can be created.

The aggregation of the metrics is done periodically, usually every few hours. To
refresh the data inside a chart immediately, click the refresh button in the
chart itself.

For more information about adding metrics to your devices:

- Bare Metal/RTOS: see the [Metrics Guide](https://mflt.io/embedded-metrics)
- Android: update to the 3.0+ version of the
  [Bort SDK](https://mflt.io/android-bort-sdk)

### Issue Charts

Issue Charts show an aggregation of a selection of Issues of your choice and
their occurrence over time. They share some of the features of Metric Charts,
including [Comparison Mode](#comparison-mode).

You can use Issue Charts to group together Issues that have something in common,
or represent a class of bugs, in order to track changes in their occurrence over
time.

To create an Issue Chart, click on **Create Chart** and select **Issue Chart**.
Search and select the Issues you're interested in and **Add** them. You can
update the selected Issues later as well.

### Filtering Charts

You can filter the values visible in the charts by selecting from the available
filters on the top-right area of the page:

### Comparison Mode

To compare the data from different sets of Devices, you can click the `Compare`
button next to the filters section on the top-right area of the page to add a
new colorized selection to the filters as well as the charts:

When comparing Metric and Issue Charts, bear in mind that the aggregations
`Count` and `Sum` lead to absolute values that are a function of the number of
Devices reporting the given value. When visualizing absolute values for
different sets of Devices, the resulting chart could be misleading as the
underlying number of Devices per set may vary.

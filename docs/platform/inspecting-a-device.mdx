Individual **Devices** can be accessed through many parts of the web
application, for example by clicking on a Device's serial number on the
_Devices_ search page.

## Device details

Most of the metadata describing the Device lives in the _Details_ section. You
can view the
[hardware version and last reported software version](./software-version-hardware-version.mdx),
as well as when the device first and last contacted Memfault. You can also
define some metadata yourself, namely the _Nickname_ and _Notes_ for the Device.
This can be useful, for example, to record your notes from a debugging session.

### Linked Devices

:::note

This feature is not automatically enabled, please contact us to discuss how it
can be enabled for your Project.

:::

In many situations a Device does not operate in a vacuum. When debugging
wireless earbuds, for example, the left and right bud is intimately linked, and
misbehavior in one can cause a crash in the other. Memfault enables your Devices
to report which other Devices they are in some way linked to, whatever "linked"
means in your particular case.

## Tabs for debugging

Below the Device details is a rich set of data reported by the Device, suitable
for both debugging and general observability. This view contains slightly
different information depending on your device, please see the pages for
[MCU devices](../mcu/introduction.mdx),
[Android devices](../android/introduction.mdx) and
[Linux devices](../linux/introduction.mdx) for more details.

### Comparing multiple devices with TimeSync mode

Sometimes it's fruitful to debug two or more Devices at the same time. They may for example be
[Linked Devices](#linked-devices), or devices that received a firmware update at the
same time, among many other possibilities.

Whenever one wishes to view many Device Details pages at the same time, the solution is delightfully
low-tech: just open up multiple browser windows and lay them out as needed! However, this gets
complicated very quickly, especially if one wants the windows to show the same time and date ranges
while looking at debugging data.

To help, we have developed a feature called **TimeSync**, which synchronizes time-related aspects
of the UI between browser windows.

![Animation showing the mouse hovering over a Device timeline and changing date range settings, with the same things happening in a separate browser window as well](/img/docs/platform/timesync-demo.gif)

To see this in action, go to a Device's **Timeline** tab and click on the small clock icon next
to the date picker. You can also use the Timezone picker in the upper right corner to enable
TimeSync. Whenever TimeSync is enabled, the little clock icon stops showing the current time
(for your selected timezone) and starts spinning quickly.

Now, if you open a new browser window and view another Device's Timeline, you will see that
the date range stays the same in both windows, and that hovering your mouse pointer over the timeline shows
the "needle" in both places.

:::note

TimeSync is currently enabled for the Timeline tab in the Device details page. This feature only works across
windows of _the same browser_. Mixing Chrome and Edge will not work, for example.

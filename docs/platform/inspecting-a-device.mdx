Individual **Devices** can be accessed through many parts of the web
application, for example by clicking on a Device's serial number on the
_Devices_ search page.

## Device details

Most of the metadata describing the Device lives in the _Details_ section. You
can view the
[hardware version and last reported software version](./software-version-hardware-version.mdx),
as well as when the device first and last contacted Memfault. You can also
define some metadata yourself, namely the _Nickname_ and _Notes_ for the Device.
This can be useful, for example, to record your notes from a debugging session.

### Linked Devices

:::note

This feature is not automatically enabled, please contact us to discuss how it
can be enabled for your Project.

:::

In many situations a Device does not operate in a vacuum. When debugging
wireless earbuds, for example, the left and right bud is intimately linked, and
misbehavior in one can cause a crash in the other. Memfault enables your Devices
to report which other Devices they are in some way linked to, whatever "linked"
means in your particular case.

## Tabs for debugging

Below the Device details is a rich set of data reported by the Device, suitable
for both debugging and general observability. This view contains slightly
different information depending on your device, please see the pages for
[MCU devices](../mcu/introduction.mdx),
[Android devices](../android/introduction.mdx) and
[Linux devices](../linux/introduction.mdx) for more details.

## Custom Data Recordings

In some projects, devices already capture additional data in custom formats
which can be useful to analyze when debugging issues, for example, trace data,
proprietary coredumps, non-standard logs. Memfault allows this arbitrary
information to be bundled as a "Custom Data Recording" (CDR).

CDRs allow you to collect custom data for specific events happening on your
device. Data sent via the CDR API can be of any format, which is then visualized
and downloadable from the Device Timeline. To enable this, each CDR is bundled
with metadata when uploaded:

- [**Reason**](#cdr-reason) - This describes what was the cause/reason for
  sending the CDR. Limited to 100 different unique values.
- [**MIME types**](#cdr-mime-types) - One or more MIME types describing the
  contents of the CDR.
- **Duration** - The amount of time the CDR represents (can be 0).
- **Start Time** [Optional] - When the capture began. Defaults to the API
  server's current time in UTC minus the CDR's duration.

Some example use cases of CDRs are:

- Collecting debug data using a proprietary format
- Capturing UI heatmaps
- Recording screenshots of a device when errors occur to better understand what
  a user was seeing or doing just before a crash
- Adding test reports for devices in a hardware-in-the-loop test set up
- ...

For each unique reason given to a CDR, a swimlane is created on the timeline.
Clicking or hovering over a timeline entry will give you the metadata of the CDR
as well as the option to download the data for further analysis.

### CDR Reason {#cdr-reason}

In principle, the reason fields is a free-form string field. A project can only
have 100 different CDR reasons. Our recommendation is to treat the reason as an
"enum" and use only a small set of static values. In the Device Timeline, all
CDRs with the same reason are shown in the same swimlane.

Some examples: for a connected device with a display, we might want to capture
the modem logs when it disconnects. We could be using `Modem Disconnect` for the
reason field. Aside of that, we may also want to capture a screenshot image
after a crash happened (and the user gave consent to upload a screenshot). Here,
we'll use the reason `User Feedback Post Crash` as the reason.

In the future, Memfault will also extend the Device Search to enable searching
for devices having CDRs with a given (set of) reasons.

### CDR MIME types {#cdr-mime-types}

Memfault uses the MIME types array provided to infer the best visualization to
use in the Timeline. The MIME types in the array are expected to be ordered by
specificity (most specific first). The visualization for the most-specific but
supported MIME type will be used by the Timeline.

:::note

When using proprietary MIME types, we recommend using one of the types in the
[table below](#cdr-supported-visualizations) as the last entry (fallback) in the
MIME types list.

:::

For example, for the modem logs CDR from the connected device we talked about in
the previous section, we may be using a MIME types list of:
`application/vnd.acme-inc.modem-trace.v2`, `application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap`,
`application/octet-stream`.

The first and most-specific MIME type is
`application/vnd.acme-inc.modem-trace.v2`. This is a self-coined (not
[IANA-registered][iana-mime-types]), vendor-specific MIME type, as indicated by
the `vnd.` prefix.

The modem logs happen to be recorded in a format that is a superset of the pcap
format. Therefore, we use `application/vnd.tcpdump.pcap` as the second MIME type
in the list. This is the [official IANA-registered][iana-mime-types] type for a
pcap file (Wireshark dump).

Lastly, `application/octet-stream` is used in the MIME types list. This type is
essentially means "application specific binary data".

Even though Memfault does not have a Timeline visualizer for pcap data, let
alone the vendor-specific format extensions to pcap, it might be added some day
in the future. It also helps to identify the format of the payload when
downloading it from the device timeline. For this reason, we recommended using
an accurate list of MIME types.

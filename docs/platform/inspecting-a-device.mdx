Individual **Devices** can be accessed through many parts of the web
application, for example by clicking on a Device's serial number on the
_Devices_ search page.

## Device details

Most of the metadata describing the Device lives in the _Details_ section. You
can view the
[hardware version and last reported software version](./software-version-hardware-version.mdx),
as well as when the device first and last contacted Memfault. You can also
define some metadata yourself, namely the _Nickname_ and _Notes_ for the Device.
This can be useful, for example, to record your notes from a debugging session.

### Linked Devices

:::note

This feature is not automatically enabled, please contact us to discuss how it
can be enabled for your Project.

:::

In many situations a Device does not operate in a vacuum. When debugging
wireless earbuds, for example, the left and right bud is intimately linked, and
misbehavior in one can cause a crash in the other. Memfault enables your Devices
to report which other Devices they are in some way linked to, whatever "linked"
means in your particular case.

## Tabs for debugging

Below the Device details is a rich set of data reported by the Device, suitable
for both debugging and general observability. This view contains slightly
different information depending on your device, please see the pages for
[MCU devices](../mcu/introduction.mdx),
[Android devices](../android/introduction.mdx) and
[Linux devices](../linux/introduction.mdx) for more details.

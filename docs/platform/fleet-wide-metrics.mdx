Memfault indexes and aggregates the metrics collected by your devices to provide
you not only with insights of how individual devices are performing, but also
the emergent behavior of your entire fleet.

You can add charts to visualize these aggregated, fleet-wide metrics by
navigating to the sidebar and selecting **Dashboards** and then **Metrics**.

Creating a new chart is as simple as clicking `Create Chart`, selecting your
metric of interest, and choosing the desired aggregation type.

The list of metrics available in your project is automatically created from the
metrics collected by your devices. For that reason, at least one device must
upload data for a given metric before a chart for that metric can be created.

The aggregation of the metrics is done periodically, usually every few hours. To
refresh the data inside a chart immediately, click the refresh button in the
chart itself.

For more information about adding metrics to your devices:

- Bare Metal/RTOS: see the [Metrics Guide](https://mflt.io/embedded-metrics)
- Android: update to the 3.0+ version of the
  [Bort SDK](https://mflt.io/android-bort-sdk)

## Filtering Metric Charts

You can filter the values visible in the charts by selecting from the available
filters on the top-right area of the page:

## Metric Chart Comparison Mode

To compare the values of different sets of Devices, you can click the `Compare`
button next to the filters section on the top-right area of the page to add a
new colorized selection to the filters as well as the charts:

When comparing Metric Charts, bear in mind that the aggregations `Count` and
`Sum` lead to absolute values that are a function of the number of Devices
reporting the given value. When visualizing absolute values for different sets
of Devices, the resulting chart could be misleading as the underlying number of
Devices per set may vary.

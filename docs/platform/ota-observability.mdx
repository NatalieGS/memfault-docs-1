# OTA Observability

## Deployment Matrix

The deployment matrix provides an overview of current and future device versions
per Cohort. To access the deployment matrix, navigate to **Fleet > Cohorts** and
select a Cohort to explore.

Matrix columns represent a filtered representation of Releases.

Generally, Releases are displayed as matrix columns if devices are on or will
upgrade to a Software Version associated with the displayed Release. If a
Release has an active Deployment, the `Active` button is visible below the
version number of the Release. If the Release has an associated Deployment that
is marked as Must Pass Through (MPT), a button with the label `MPT` is
displayed.

The rows of the matrix (Current Versions) represent versions that devices
report, grouped by Software Type and Hardware Version.

**Example**: A device with the primary Software Type `proto` that reports to be
on version `0.9.0` will appear in the row `0.9.0 (proto)`. If the cohort has an
active Release for a later version with the version name `1.0.0`, the device
will appear in the column `1.0.0`.

In short, the deployment matrix provides a conclusive summary of the versions
devices are currently on and will eventually upgrade to - if an update is
available.

Available actions in the deployment matrix are:

- Abort a deployment for a release
- Clicking on a device count to see a filtered-down list of devices

## Inspect Devices That Aren’t in the Expected Column

If a device shows up in a column you weren’t expecting it to, additional
information can be obtained via the device detail page. By clicking on the
deployment matrix cell with the affected devices, you navigate to a filtered
device list.

Here you can choose an affected device to inspect:

On the device detail page, open the update inspector panel by clicking on the
icon next to “Last Seen Software Version”.

The inspector panel provides a high-level overview of a device’s update history
and future. On the left side of the popover, you can inspect the Software
Versions a device has reported recently. On the right side of the popover, you
find the next available update to the device.

To retrieve further information, click on “Inspect Details''. The displayed
dialog provides detailed information about the device’s update behavior.

Common reasons for unexpected upgrade behavior are:

- **Min version not met**: The minimum version associated with a release was not
  met.
- **Not newer**: The newest available release would lead to a version lower than
  the device’s current version.

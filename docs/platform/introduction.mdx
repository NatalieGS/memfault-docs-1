Memfault is a cloud platform that allows you and your team to continuously
monitor devices, debug firmware issues, and deploy OTA updates to your fleet to
ship hardware products at the speed of software.

- Memfault is **embedded-first**: embedded systems and devices running on any
  RTOS or operating systems such as Android or Linux are supported.
- It **runs on any device**: from powerful SoCs down to MCUs with the most
  constrained capabilities, Memfault will fit into your deviceâ€™s available
  flash, RAM, and bandwidth.
- Our SDKs are made with **low and intermittent connectivity** in mind: if your
  device can only send out a small amount of data, you'll be able to ration it
  in chunks of the size you choose, and we'll take care of transporting it for
  you. If your device relies on a companion (such as a mobile phone) for
  Internet access, you can use it as a bridge. You can also post data directly
  from your device.
- **Privacy** is built into Memfault: you have full control over what your
  Memfault-enabled devices send to our servers.

Our platform is a **one-stop shop** for:

- [Debugging](#debugging).
- [Over-the-air (OTA) updates](#ota).
- [Monitoring via metrics](#metrics).

## Debugging {#debugging}

On your devices, Memfault keeps track of crashes automatically and will make
crash reports available to you on the Memfault web application as soon as
they're uploaded.

Our web application offers a rich and complete view into your collected MCU
[traces](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology/#trace) and Android exceptions and
Bug Reports. With them, there's **no need ship the device to your facility**, or
attach a debug probe to it. Even if you have the device at hand, you'll find
Memfault traces to be a better place to debug, thanks to many **helpful
visualizations** and connected data we display from our parsing. You'll find
Memfault traces are useful to you even during development.

**Reproducing customer issues** is easier than ever before. Consider a workflow
where a customer support agent files a ticket for engineering that already
includes a Memfault link to the particular device that's having issues, or even
a link to the trace itself.

Memfault traces go through a process of deduplication, so that you don't have to
look at every single instance of a problem. A group of collected traces with
matching error reasons is called an
[Issue](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology/#issue) in Memfault. Even after
deduplication, you can still access all available traces of an Issue.

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates {#ota}

Memfault changes the way teams prepare updates. Instead of handing a pilot
device over to QA and waiting for bugs to be found, to then fix them and repeat
the process, consider the following workflow:

Traditionally, the process looks like this: hand a pilot device over to QA and
wait for bugs to be found, to then fix them and repeat. Memfault changes and
improves upon this process. Consider the following additions to that workflow:

- Using Memfault [Cohorts](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology/#cohort), split
  your devices into a production Cohort and a beta Cohort.
- Configure an automatic update for devices in the beta Cohort.
- Measure success metrics via Monitoring, number of reboots or crashes.
- Once your software is ready, enable the update for all production devices.

Memfault OTA updates enable this streamlined workflow as well as complex setups
that may include staged rollouts (aiming at only a fraction of your population),
delta releases (also known as incremental updates), and many more representable
scenarios.

Memfault OTA updates provide increased velocity, reduce the risk of rolling out
an update, and offer visibility into team productivity.

    product. Around 1.3K devices out of 9.1K in this fleet will receive the
    latest version as a canary release, and the team will monitor the behavior
    of the new firmware.

To benefit from the increased velocity while still maintaining the high
standards of quality required by the nature of hardware products, use the rest
of the Memfault feature suite: Debugging and Metrics.

## Monitoring via Metrics {#metrics}

Memfault makes it easy to collect new data from your devices. In any of our
SDKs, it's a matter of writing two lines of C or Kotlin. Since Memfault takes
care of the plumbing and the multipart transport, adding a new metric does not
involve data scientists, your web backend team, or your mobile app developers.

Adding metrics to your Memfault integration unlocks many features whose value
compounds with all other features of Memfault.

### Device metrics

A timeline view for every single individual device showcasing its metrics,
including time-series data, reboots and crashes.

### Fleet metrics

Among others, adding metrics to your Memfault integration unlocks:

- [Device Attributes][device-attributes] and time-series data across your whole
  fleet.
- [Custom Metric charts][custom-metric-charts] that aggregate the value of your
  metrics across your fleet, sliced by Cohort or Software Version.
- [Email alerts][alerts] based on your own configured thresholds.
- A rich [device search][device-search] view that allows you to express the most
  complex queries.
- [Device Sets][device-sets]: a way to visualize the change in the count
  resulting from device searches over time.

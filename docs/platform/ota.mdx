# Over-the-Air Updates (OTA)

Memfault provides secure and scalable updates for all IoT devices
([MCU][platform-mcu], [Android][platform-android], [Linux][platform-linux], or a
combination of them). With [real-time monitoring](/docs/platform/charts) and
controlled releases, you can debug and ship new releases confidently.

## Introduction and Concepts

To deliver OTA Updates:

- Memfault users have different ways to configure which OTA payloads to
  distribute to which devices.
- Each device polls Memfault's [Latest Release endpoint][endpoint].
- Memfault uses [various inputs](#updating-behavior), predominantly the current
  Software Version of the device, to decide what to return.
- Each device may receive information about a new available payload.
- Ultimately, this process is meant to replace or update the software running on
  a device.

platform:

- [OTA Updates for MCU devices][platform-mcu],
- [OTA Updates for Android (AOSP)][platform-android],
- [OTA Updates for Embedded Linux][platform-linux].

Read about related Memfault-specific terminology that you may need to refer to
to better grasp the contents of this document:

- [Software Versions and Hardware Versions](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version).
- [Version Schemes](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version#version-schemes)
  to understand Software Version ordering.
- Generic
  [Memfault terminology documentation](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology).

Memfault provides two Release entities to solve the challenges of over-the-air
updates: Full Releases and Delta Releases.

### Full Releases

Full Releases provide a way to upgrade device Software Versions regardless of
the version the device is currently on.

If we define the version of the most current Release as `2.0` and every version
lower than `2.0` as `*`, we can describe the behavior of a Full Release as:
`[*→2.0]`.

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details.

#### Must-pass-through Full Releases

Full Releases can be marked as _must-pass-through_, or MPT for short. When a MPT
Release is activated, a device on a lower version will be forced to "pass
through" this Release before an update is allowed to a Full Release with a
version greater than that of the MPT Release. Typically this setting is not
needed.

### Delta Releases

A Delta Release describes a transition from exactly one From Version to exactly
one To Version. The behavior can be described as: `[1.0→2.0]`.

Note that Delta Releases are referred to as ["incremental updates" in Android
documentation][incremental], or "differential updates" in other places.

A Delta Release is only applied when the device’s current version matches the
Release’s From Version.

Delta Releases allow for more fine-grained control over the update paths of
devices. Additionally, Delta Releases generally contain smaller payloads,
reducing required bandwidth and costs associated with rolling out updates.

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details.

### Activating a Release

You can activate a Release for a Cohort of your choice. While Releases are
shared between all Cohorts, activating them happens on a per-Cohort basis.

When activating a Release for a Cohort, you can choose between two behaviors:

#### Normal Activation of a Release

Releases activated _normally_ are available immediately to all devices in a
Cohort.

#### Staged Rollout of a Release

Staged-rollout Release Activations can be used to make a Release available to a
Cohort incrementally.

When a staged-rollout Release Activation is created for a Cohort, a random
subset of its devices (amounting to the selected rollout percentage) will be
marked as _staged_ in this Cohort. Staged-rollout deployments are only
applicable to devices that are _staged_ in the Cohort.

### Best Practices When Activating Releases

Memfault enables risk mitigation through different mechanisms.

#### Monitoring the effect of Releases

As part of your OTA management workflow, make sure to set up
[Metric and Issue Charts](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts) to monitor the
health of your fleet. You can use
[Comparison Mode](/docs/platform/charts#comparison-mode) to see how devices in a
different Cohort or in a newer Software Version are doing relative to other
devices.

#### Activating Releases in a test Cohort first

Since Releases are shared among all Cohorts, you can use the Release activation
mechanism to test a Release in (for example) a `beta` Cohort before activating
the same Release in a `production` Cohort. Once you've gained confidence through
[monitoring](#monitoring-the-effect-of-releases) that the software in a new
Release is working as expected, you can activate the Release for a bigger
Cohort.

#### Using staged-rollout Releases

Releases activated using a [staged rollout](#staged-rollout-of-a-release) can be
used to limit the amount of devices that will download a specific Release,
reducing the risk of shipping bugs to a greater portion of the fleet. Once
you've gained confidence through
[monitoring](#monitoring-the-effect-of-releases) that the software in a new
staged-rollout Release is working as expected, you can increase its rollout
percentage.

## Updating Behavior

When a device queries the [Latest Release endpoint][endpoint], the Memfault
platform needs to decide which OTA payload to send it. This section covers the
behavior of our backend when receiving one such query.

In this section, we'll sometimes refer to one Software Version being higher or
lower than another. To understand how Memfault resolves Software Version
ordering, refer to the
[Version Schemes](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version#version-schemes)
documentation section.

:::info

If you wish to better understand Memfault's behavior from the point of view of a
specific device, you can use the
"[Inspect details](#debugging-your-configuration)" feature in the **device
details** view.

### Applicability of an OTA Release

Along with the query to the Latest Release endpoint, a device sends:

- the Device ID (device serial) to determine its Cohort,
- the [Software Type][terminology] to determine the set of Releases against
  which to apply these rules,
- its current [Software Version][terminology],
- device-specific attributes such as [Hardware Version][terminology].

A Release must be [active](#activating-a-release) for the Cohort a device is in
to be applicable.

To determine if an active Release is applicable to a device, its payload
attributes are tested against the parameters sent by the device. If they don’t
match, a Release is considered to be incompatible and treated as if it did not
exist.

An Release activated as a [staged-rollout](#staged-rollout-of-a-release) will
only be applicable to the _staged_ portion of the Cohort it targets. In other
words, if the device is not _staged_ in its Cohort, such Releases will not be
applicable.

### Choosing Among Multiple Applicable OTA Releases

If a device has multiple possible update paths, the following rules of
precedence apply to determine which release is selected.

The following rules apply to all active Releases per Cohort:

1. Use a Delta Release whose From Version matches the current version of the
   device.
2. Otherwise, use a must-pass-through (MPT) Release with the lowest Target
   Version that’s greater than the current version of the device.
3. Otherwise, use a Full Release with the highest To Version greater than the
   current version of the device.

In short, the precedence can be summarized like so: **Delta Release** > **MPT
Release** > **Full Release**.

## Managing OTA Updates with Memfault

The Memfault application contains OTA-related features in several of its views.

### OTA Releases

The **OTA Releases** section of the Memfault application can be accessed from
the main menu on the left side. In it, you’ll be able to access a list view of
all Full Releases and the equivalent list view for Delta Releases by selecting
one of the tabs under the title of the page.

Let's take a look at how to create Releases using the Memfault application.

:::important

Please note that the Release version you choose is expected to match the
Software Version a device will report once it has installed the OTA payload for
this Release.

:::

#### Creating a Full Release

To create a Full Release, click on the _Create Release_ button on the top-right
area of the **OTA Releases** view. Among other information, you'll be prompted
for a version and whether the Release is a must-pass-through (MPT) Release.

#### Creating a Delta Release

To create a Delta Release, click on the drop-down icon next to the _Create
Release_ button on the top-right area of the **OTA Releases** view, and select
_Create Delta Release_. Among other information, you'll be prompted for a From
Version and a To Version.

#### Adding an OTA payload to a Release

Once you've created a Release, you'll be redirected to the **Release detail**
view. To add an OTA payload, click on the _Add OTA payload to Release_ button on
the top-right corner of the _OTA payloads_ card.

Alongside the actual payload file, you'll be prompted for different inputs that
a device querying the [Latest Release endpoint][endpoint] must match for this
Release to be applicable to it.

See the [updating behavior](#updating-behavior) section for more details.

### Cohorts View

In the **Cohorts** list view, accessible from the main menu on the left side of
the application, some OTA-related information is available for each Cohort:

- Whether a Release is active for the Cohort (under the _Deployment_ column).
- A software distribution widget (under the _Software Distribution_ column).

The distribution of Software Versions in this Cohort is shown in different
sections of the software distribution widget, with the Software Version
representing the ongoing active Release highlighted and placed at the start.

### Debugging Your Configuration

If a device in your fleet is not downloading the OTA payload you anticipated
from our description of [update behavior](#update-behavior), you can use the
**device details view** to find out about the Software Version history of each
particular device, and to inspect the result of it calling the [Latest Release
endpoint][endpoint].

![Inspecting device Software Version history details](/img/docs/platform/ota/device-details-inspect-min.png)
The _Inspect details_ feature allows you to see the result of calling the Latest
Release endpoint as this device.

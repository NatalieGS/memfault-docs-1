The Bort SDK includes a full OTA Update Client since version 3.7.0, which uses
the
[Memfault Android OTA service](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide)
to manage the OTA update process. This supports:

- [`RecoverySystem`-based updates](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/nonab).
- [Update Engine-based updates](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab#life-of-an-a-b-update)
  (also known as **A/B** or **Seamless** updates).
- Checking for updates (both regularly in the background, and manually via the
  system Settings menu). Check interval can be configured dynamically on the
  Memfault dashboard.
- Downloading updates (and resuming interrupted downloads).
- UI notifications of available updates, and download progress.
- Incremental updates, referred to as
  [Delta Releases](/docs/platform/ota/#delta-releases) in Memfault lingo.

In future updates, additional features will be supported:

- Further remote configuration of update behavior (e.g. headless update
  behavior, force-update policy).

## OTA Update Client behavior

This behavior can be customized by modifying the `bort-ota` application. More
behavior will be remotely configurable in future releases of the OTA Update
Client.

The OTA Update Client will periodically check for updates. By default, this
happens every 12 hours. When an update is found, a notification is displayed.

:::info

This regular, periodic check will only happen when:

- Storage is not low.
- Battery is not low.
- An unmetered network connection (e.g. wifi) is available.

A "Software Updates" system settings screen is added. Users can manually check
for updates on this screen.

When an update is found, the notification will redirect users to the settings
screen, where they can read release notes, download, and apply the update.

## OTA Update Client architecture

The OTA Update Client is included in the Bort SDK as a separate app. As with the
rest of the Bort SDK, this is open-source, and can be found in the
[bort-ota](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/master/MemfaultPackages/bort-ota)
project.

**The OTA Update Client is optional, and will not be included in your system
image if not required**.

The `bort-ota` app is designed to be customizable (for example, to customize the
notification UI). All customizations should be made within the `bort-ota`
project.

The `bort-ota-lib` library project contains the core OTA logic, and is **not**
intended to be customized.

The OTA Update Client required the main Bort application to be installed and
running, in order to function correctly.

## Enable OTA Update Client

Ensure that the Bort OTA application ID is set (see
[Patch the SDK](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide#patch-the-sdk) or
manually update `BORT_OTA_APPLICATION_ID` in `bort.properties`).

The OTA app also needs to be configured with a keystore. See
[Create a keystore for the OTA Update Client app](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide#create-a-keystore-for-the-bort-ota-update-client-app).

Once the OTA application is configured, setting the `TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA`
environment variable will include it in the system image. e.g.

```bash
export TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA=1
```

After building and installing the system image, the Memfault OTA app will be
active. A Release can now be
[activated in the Cohort](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide#activate-the-release)
containing this device.

## Customizing the OTA Update Client

### String translations

The strings used in the various UI elements (notifications, check for updates
screen) are located in `bort-ota/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. You may want
to either customize, or translate these into other languages. See the
[Android documentation for more information](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization#creating-alternatives).

## Updating the OTA Update Client

The OTA Update Client application can (just like the main Bort application) be
updated using the Android package manager. If a device has an MDM capability,
then this can be used to update the OTA apk in the future, without a full OS
update.

It may still be necessary to update the OS for certain new features, if they
required AOSP modifications.

## Testing OTA updates

It is recommended to thoroughly test the entire OTA update process after
integrating the OTA Update Client. This should always include testing the
ability to update **from** any new OS version.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the `TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA` environment variable is set in the
environments where **both** the gradle build, and AOSP build, take place.
Without this, the OTA app will not be included, or may not be correctly
configured.

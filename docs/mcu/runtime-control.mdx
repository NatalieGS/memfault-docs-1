This guide covers how to enable and disable Memfault at runtime (vs. at
compile-time). This can vary widely depending on the particular integration
strategy or system, so some examples are provided after the general information
section.

## Overall Strategy

The recommended way to deactivate Memfault at runtime is to turn off the
mechanism used to send Memfault chunks to the cloud.

This allows you to pull Memfault diagnostic data off of devices manually if you
have a direct connection to the device such as JTAG, serial, etc or re-enable
dynamically and get historical context immediately.

To accomplish this one needs to add a check around the system the packetizer
APIs are used (see [here](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud) for
details).

For example, you might use a variable to control whether sending is attempted
(perhaps loaded from NVRAM settings database on device):

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

static bool enable_memfault_upload = false;

...
void periodic_task(void) {
  if (s_enable_memfault_upload) {
    try_send_memfault_data();
  }
}
```

Note that this only disables the sending of Memfault data. All the collection
mechanisms will still be enabled as usual (eg coredump saving, metrics, etc).

## Zephyr (including nRF Connect SDK)

This will depend on if `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=y` is used.

### CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=y

These instructions are based on
[the example in the nrf-connect SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/master/samples/nrf9160/memfault):

1. disable `MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD` in Kconfig (i.e. in your prj.conf)
2. Add this content to one of your source files (eg main or wherever makes
   sense):
   https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/4ec7a0c61f9c8c94c74c0d31ca0e76c190010bfc/ports/zephyr/common/memfault_http_periodic_upload.c
3. use `k_timer_start` and `k_timer_stop` on that timer to control the automatic
   posting of data

### CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=n

If `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=n` (default), you'll need to follow the
[overalll strategy](#overall-strategy) explained above when disabling the chunks
sending.

MCU development is incredibly complicated. A given platform not only consists of the chosen MCU hardware, but also many other options such as:

* SDK/Framework/RTOS availability
* Compiler/toolchain options
* IDE/build system options

While we cannot support every platform, we strive to cover as many as possible. This page is a reference for what platforms we support with our MCU SDK.

## Minimum Requirements

The Memfault MCU SDK does have a few minimum requirements on the hardware it runs on:

| Attribute | Constraint |
| --------- | ---------- |
| RAM       | > 16 kB    |
| ROM       | > 32 kB    |
| Core      | 32-bit     |

These limits do not represent how much RAM/ROM the MCU SDK uses, but rather the minimum sizes that we find are doable to integrate with.

## Supported Hardware Families

This table represents a list of hardware families that are supported by the MCU SDK. This list is not exhaustive. If you don't see your MCU
on this list but it is a Cortex-M, please see our general Cortex-M Getting Started Guide for more info on adding the MCU SDK into your system.

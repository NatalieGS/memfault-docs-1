title: Async Data Source Mode
---

Occasionally, you may want to read data from one of the data sources the
packetizer is accessing in an asynchronous / event driven fashion. For example,
this may be desirable if a bare metal environment is being used and coredumps
are being saved to a storage medium which can be slow to access (such as
external flash).

There are several properties of the SDK packetizer that are helpful for
achieving this behavior:

1. The packetizer guarantees individual data sources (i.e platform coredump
   storage) will be read sequentially.
2. Each call to `memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()` will result in exactly _one_
   read to the data source which is active. The size of the read will be less
   than or equal to the size of the chunk requested.
3. The Memfault SDK allows for different APIs to be used when saving data and
   when reading back data via the packetizer. For the "coredump" feature,
   [`memfault_coredump_read()`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/panics/platform/coredump.h#L106-L118)
   is the routine which is called when reading data from the packetizer.

These features are all verified on each release as part of the Memfault Firmware
SDK
[unit test suite](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/tests).

Using these features, we can easily load data from a slower storage in an
asynchronous fashion. Once the data has been preloaded, we can then call
Memfault packetizer APIs. Let's walk some example code for how asynchronous
reads to coredump storage could be achieved.

#### Example Code

:::note

In order to operate in asychronous operation mode, RLE data source compression
must be disabled. This is because RLE Compression requires several passes over
the underlying data. The feature can be disabled by either removing
`memfault_data_source_rle.c` from your build system or by adding the define
`MEMFAULT_DATA_SOURCE_RLE_ENABLED=0` to your compilation flags.

:::

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_packetizer.h"

bool try_send_memfault_data(void) {
  uint8_t buffer[USER_CHUNK_SIZE];

  bool async_call_dispatched = memfault_platform_coredump_prepare_async(USER_CHUNK_SIZE);
  if (async_call_dispatched) {
    // we need to wait for the call to complete before we can load new data
    // via memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()
    return false;
  }

  size_t read_size = sizeof(buffer);
  bool data_available = memfault_packetizer_get_chunk(buffer, &read_size);
  if (!data_available) {
    return false;
  }

  //! this is a call to the system specific function which sends the data
  send_ble_gatt_packet(buffer, read_size);
  return true;
}
```

and then in the platform coredump code,
`memfault_platform_coredump_prepare_async()` would look something like:

```c
//! Structure used to track data which has been preloaded prior to making
//! calls to `memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()`
typedef struct {
  // buffer to hold pre-loaded data
  // Size just needs to be >= the chunk size that will be read
  uint8_t buf[128];
  // the amount of data which has been loaded
  uint32_t bytes_loaded;
  // the address the buffer starts at. So, for example, if the buffer holds bytes from offset 200-240
  // of coredump storage, this value would be 200
  uint32_t start_addr;
  // the offset within 'buf' that last call to memfault_coredump_read() ended at
  uint32_t last_read_offset;
} sMfltCoredumpAsyncReadBuf;

static sMfltCoredumpAsyncReadBuf s_read_buf;

//! Checks to see if more coredump data needs to be loaded from slow storage prior to invoking the
//! next `memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()` call
//!
//! @return true if an asynchronous read operation was dispatched, else true if
//! `memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()` can be called immediately
bool memfault_platform_coredump_prepare_async(size_t next_chunk_size) {
  const size_t bytes_remaining = s_read_buf.bytes_loaded - s_read_buf.last_read_offset;
  if (bytes_remaining > next_chunk_size) {
    // we have enough data pre-loaded for the next memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()
    // call to succeed
    return false;
  }

  sMfltCoredumpStorageInfo info;
  memfault_platform_coredump_storage_get_info(&info);
  const size_t start_addr = s_read_buf.start_addr + s_read_buf.last_read_offset;
  const size_t bytes_to_read = MEMFAULT_MIN(sizeof(s_read_buf.buf), info.size - start_addr);

  s_read_buf.start_addr = start_addr;
  s_read_buf.last_read_offset = start_addr;
  s_read_buf.bytes_loaded = bytes_to_read;

  // Call async read routine for flash storage and let caller know we will have to wait for a result
  user_coredump_storage_read_async(start_addr, &s_read_buf.buf, bytes_to_read);
  return true;
}
```

Then `memfault_coredump_read()` can just access data from the `s_read_buf` we
populated asynchronously.

```c
bool memfault_coredump_read(uint32_t offset, void *data, size_t read_len) {
  if (offset < s_read_buf.start_addr ||
      ((offset + read_len) > (s_read_buf.start_addr + s_read_buf.bytes_loaded))) {
    // This means memfault_platform_coredump_prepare_async() was not
    // run prior to calling `memfault_packetizer_get_chunk()` and should never happen
    return false;
  }

  const size_t read_offset = offset - s_read_buf.start_addr;
  const uint8_t *read_ptr = &s_read_buf.buf[read_offset];
  memcpy(data, read_ptr, read_len);
  s_read_buf.last_read_offset = read_offset + read_len;
  return true;
}
```

Finally, when the data is cleared at the end of reading the data source, we
reset the ram buffer so it looks empty and dispatch an erase to the backing
storage.

```c
void memfault_platform_coredump_storage_clear(void) {
  // reset pre-loaded storage to offset zero and "erase" the data by
  // populating the buffer with all zeros
  s_read_buf = (sMfltCoredumpAsyncReadBuf) {
    .bytes_loaded = sizeof(s_read_buf.buf),
    .start_addr = 0,
    .last_read_offset = 0,
  };

  // erase backing flash storage as well
  user_coredump_storage_erase_async();
}
```

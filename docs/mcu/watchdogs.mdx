This document describes the necessary integration details to capture coredumps
when a Watchdog occurs.

An example of a captured Watchdog crash below:

## Enabling a Watchdog Timer

This guide assumes a Watchdog Timer is already present and enabled on the
system. For some general background on Watchdog Timers and recommendations on
how to use them, see this article:

<https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-watchdog-best-practices>

## Instrumenting Watchdogs with Memfault

When using the Memfault SDK, we recommend instrumenting the watchdog timer so a
coredump will be captured when the watchdog trips.

The fundamental technique is to use Memfault's
[Watchdog interrupt handler](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.1/components/panics/src/memfault_fault_handling_arm.c#L286)
to trap the interrupt when the watchdog fires- this provides the best backtrace
result, since it uses the Memfault interrupt shim.

To use it, make sure that the `MEMFAULT_EXC_HANDLER_WATCHDOG` Memfault SDK
config is set to the name of the Watchdog interrupt handler registered in your
interrupt vector table (this config is usually set in the
`memfault_platform_config.h` header file), and there is no competing
implementation.

In order for the coredump save to complete, the chip will need to be configured
to fire the interrupt for the Watchdog Timer, but not immediately reset.

<!--

This is really not recommended, since the backtrace won't be as nice as with the
above technique. Leaving it for future reference only.

```c
void WDOG1_IRQHandler(void) {
  // optionally, do one last feed here of the hardware watchdog in case more
  // time is needed to ensure the coredump save can finish

  // trigger a Memfault software watchdog
  MEMFAULT_SOFTWARE_WATCHDOG();
}
```

-->

## Configuring Watchdog Timer Warning Threshold

Depending on the particular chip, there's often a "warning" threshold that can
be configured into the watchdog, which will trigger an interrupt some period
before the watchdog reset occurs.

For example, on the NXP RT1021 chip (from the
[RT1020 Refernce Manual](https://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/NXP_RT1020_RM.pdf)):

If available, be sure to set up the warning threshold at a sufficiently long
timeout for the coredump saving to have enough time to finish (for example, if
there are long flash page erase times that need to be accounted for).

We typically recommend a relatively long timeout, such as 10 seconds, but be
sure to consult the flash chip documentation to ensure enough time is reserved.

If the hardware watchdog does not permit a "warning" threshold of sufficient
time, it may instead make sense to set the hardware watchdog to a very long
period, and use a timer peripheral interrupt to trigger the Memfault software
watchdog.

## Petting the Watchdog Prior to Coredump Save

The actual writing of the coredump to the platform storage medium is the time
consuming part of the coredump capture.

One technique that may be useful is to apply one last reset of the watchdog
timer (often called "petting" the watchdog) prior to the coredump save
operation. The place to insert the watchdog timer reset is in this
weakly-defined function:

```c
//! Called prior to invoking any platform_storage_[read/write/erase] calls upon crash
//!
//! @note a weak no-op version of this API is defined in memfault_coredump.c because many platforms will
//! not need to implement this at all. Some potential use cases:
//!   - re-configured platform storage driver to be poll instead of interrupt based
//!   - give watchdog one last feed prior to storage code getting called it
//! @return true if to continue saving the coredump, false to abort
extern bool memfault_platform_coredump_save_begin(void);
```

## Sample Integrations

Memfault provides several example implementations of software watchdogs, which
can be used as-is or as a reference for your own implementation:

- [Generic header and description for custom implementation](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/include/memfault/ports/watchdog.h)
- [NRF5 SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/nrf5_sdk/software_watchdog.c)
- [SiLabs EMLIB](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/emlib/wdog_software_watchdog.c)
- [Dialog DA1468x](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/dialog/da1468x/wdog_software_watchdog.c)
- [STM32H7](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/stm32cube/h7/lptim_software_watchdog.c)
- [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.33.2/ports/zephyr/common/memfault_software_watchdog.c)

## Understanding Battery Life at Scale

<!-- TODO

- state-of-health (some battery chargers / PMICs compute this)
- charge cycles or coulomb counting for watching battery wear
- tracking device temperature in combination with battery discharge stats, since
  the two are often correlated

-->

Understanding battery life expectations, trends, and regressions with thousands
to millions of devices in the field is _hard_.

In this guide, we will walk through common pitfalls and best practices for
accurately tracking the battery life in your fleet.

### Pitfall #1 - Sending Current Battery Life Sporadically

A firmware could be configured to send up battery life information at a
non-standard interval. It may be whenever it connects to Wi-Fi, when it's within
Bluetooth range of a cell phone, or when it's asked by a remote server for
information.

In this information report, a device would usually send the current battery life
percentage according to a pre-determined curve or a millivolt reading.

This type of information is perfect when looking at a single device's history of
battery life, but that is about it. From these individual reports, and sporadic
reports at that, a battery life drop might be missed entirely, such as in the
chart below:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="500"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-scattered-data-points.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

When only taking into account the four captured data points, the battery life
looks like it drops at a normal rate. However, there was a large drop in the
middle.

### Pitfall #2 - Ignoring Charging Status

Another common issue with reporting battery life information from devices is
that the power state is ignored. Battery life statistics that are used in
aggregations should not be taken into account if a device is currently plugged
in or charging.

For example, the chart below shows the battery life of a device over a span of
time:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="500"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-life-drop.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

The battery is discharging around 10% per data point. However, there is one
chunk of time where there is a large battery life drop, but the device is
plugged into a charger quickly and by the time the next battery life report
takes place, it's been charged and is reporting a normal-looking number again.
It might look as if the battery regression never took place!

The same goes for a device that is reporting data for long periods while
connected to a charger. It might report 100% for 3 days, and these calculations
should not be taken into account when determining battery life calculations for
a fleet of devices.

### A Better Way

Memfault recommends capturing two data points per heartbeat interval: the
current battery percentage and, more importantly, the battery drain over a fixed
interval.

For example, if the battery dropped from 97% to 94% over an hour, then the
device would report 3% as the battery life drain for that hour. It might also be
more useful to scale out the battery percentage to be more granular, such as
0-1000 to represent 0-100%.

There are a few benefits of this approach that might not be immediately obvious:

1. If an interval has a charging event, it can be thrown out or marked to be
   excluded from aggregations.
2. The calculation of average battery life drain per hour can be easily
   computed. This enables quick battery life estimations and projects, even with
   fleet sizes well into the millions.
3. Devices that are only online sporadically can still send battery life
   information to help compute statistics since the battery life drain is
   recorded every heartbeat interval and these heartbeats can be persisted and
   sent upon request.

Below are some example implementations on how to capture these two metrics
Memfault recommends.

#### Current Battery Life Implementation

Track the current battery percentage or current mV reading from the battery.

```c
static void prv_device_metrics_end_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
    // Set to our BatteryLifeDrain metric
    device_metrics_set(kDeviceMetricId_BatteryLifePct, battery_get_current_pct());
}
```

where `battery_get_current_pct()` is assumed to be the function in the
customer's firmware that would fetch the current battery percentage.

#### Battery Life Drain Implementation

Calculate the battery drain over a consistent, fixed interval of time, such as
an hour or a day, ignoring hours in which a power event took place.

```c
// Stores the battery percentage from the start of the heartbeat interval
static int32_t s_previously_recorded_battery_pct;
static bool s_charger_connected_during_hour;

static void prv_device_metrics_start_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
    // Sets the battery percentage at the start of the interval
    s_previously_recorded_battery_pct = battery_get_current_pct();
    // Determine whether a charger is connected at this exact moment.
    // If the charger is connected during the hour, this should be
    // updated by the battery/charging module too.
    s_charger_connected_during_hour = battery_get_charger_connected();
}

static void prv_device_metrics_end_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
    if (s_charger_connected_during_hour) {
        // Don't report a metric during hours with a charging event
        return;
    }

    // Calculates the drop in percentage over the heartbeat interval
    const int32_t current_battery_pct = battery_get_current_pct();
    const int32_t battery_delta = current_battery_pct - s_previously_recorded_battery_pct;

    // Set to our BatteryLifeDrain metric
    device_metrics_set(kDeviceMetricId_BatteryLifeDrain, battery_delta);
}
```

## Predicting Expected Battery Life

Need some more information here.

$$
Projected\ \#\ Days\ of\ Battery\ Life = 100 \div \frac{total\ battery\ percent\ drained\ over\ all \ heartbeats}{total\ \#\ of\ heartbeats}
$$

## Preventing Battery Life Regressions

The only real way to do this is to have a set of devices running production-like
firmware in a production-like environment because it is impossible to run
devices and firmware through the entire matrix of environmental conditions to
understand real-world power usage.

This means that if a company makes a wearable device and it's shipped all over
the world, it should be tested internally with a variety of Android and iOS
phones, versions, connectivity interference, and usage patterns, but it should
be understood that this will only be a small subset of the environments the
device will experience.

## Understanding Battery Life at Scale

Understanding battery life expectations, trends, and regressions with thousands
to millions of devices in the field is _hard_.

### Error #1 - Sending Current Battery Life Sporadically

A firmware could be configured to send up battery life information at a
non-standard interval. It may be whenever it connects to Wi-Fi, or when it's
within Bluetooth range of a cell phone, or when it's asked by a remote server
for the information.

In this information report, a device would usually send the current battery life percentage
according to a pre-determined curve or a millivolt reading.

This type of information is perfect when looking at a single device's history of battery life, but that is
about it. From these indiviual reports, and sporadic reports at that, a battery life dropped might be missed entirely, such as in the chart below.

    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-scattered-data-points.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

When only taking into account the 4 captured data points, the battery life looks like it drops at a normal rate. However, there was a large drop in the middle.

### Error #2 - Ignoring Charging Status

Another common issue with reporting battery life information from devices 
is that the power state is ignored. Battery life statistics that are used in 
aggregations should not be taken into account if a device is currently 
plugged in or charging. 

For example, the chart below shows the battery life of a device over a span of time.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="500"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/battery-life-drop.svg"
    alt="Battery life drop during period of time"
  />
</p>

The battery is discharging around 10% per data point. However,
there is one chunk of time where there is a large battery life drop, but the device is plugged into a charger quickly and by the time the next battery
life report takes place, it's been charged and is reporting a normal looking number again. It might look as if the battery regression never took place!

The same goes for a device that is reporting data for longs periods of time while connected to a charger. It might report 100% for 3 days, and these calculations should not be taken into account when determining battery life calculations for a fleet of devices. 

### A Better Way

Memfault recommends capturing two data points per heartbeat interval: the current battery percentage and, more importantly, the battery drain over a fixed interval. 

For example, if the battery dropped from 97% to 94% over an hour, then the device would report 3% as the battery life drain for that hour.

There are a few benefits of this approach that might not be immediately obvious:

1. If an interval has a charging event, it can be thrown out or marked to be excluded from aggregations.
2. The calculation of average battery life drain per hour can be easily computed. This enables quick battery life estimations and projects, even with fleet sizes well into the millions.
4. Devices that are only online sporadically can still send battery life information to help compute statistics, since the battery life drain is recorded every heartbeat interval and these heartbeats can be persisted and sent upon request.

Below are some example implementations on how to capture these two metrics Memfault recommends.

#### Current Battery Life Implementation

Track the current battery percentage or current mV reading from the battery.

   ```c
   static void prv_device_metrics_end_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
       // Set to our BatteryLifeDrain metric
       device_metrics_set(kDeviceMetricId_BatteryLifePct, battery_get_current_pct());
   }
   ```
   where `battery_get_current_pct()` is assumed to be the function in the customer's firmware that would fetch the current battery percentage.

#### Battery Life Drain Implementation

Calculate the battery drain over a consistent, fixed interval of time, such as an hour or a day.

   ```c
   // Stores the battery percentage from the start of the hearbeat interval
   static int32_t s_previously_recorded_battery_pct;

   static void prv_device_metrics_start_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
       // Sets the battery percentage at the start of the interval
       s_previously_recorded_battery_pct = battery_get_current_pct();
   }

   static void prv_device_metrics_end_heartbeat(bool is_flushing) {
       // Calculates the drop in percentage over the heartbeat interval
       const int32_t current_battery_pct = battery_get_current_pct();
       const int32_t battery_delta = current_battery_pct - s_previously_recorded_battery_pct;

       // Set to our BatteryLifeDrain metric
       device_metrics_set(kDeviceMetricId_BatteryLifeDrain, battery_delta);
   }
   ```

## Predicting Expected Battery Life

Need some more information here.

$$
Projected\ \#\ Days\ of\ Battery\ Life = 100 \div \frac{total\ battery\ percent\ drained\ over\ all \ heartbeats}{total\ \#\ of\ heartbeats}
$$

## Preventing Battery Life Regressions

The only real way to do this is to have a set of devices running production-like
firmware in a production-like environment. This means that if a company makes a
wearable device and it's shipped all over the world, it should be tested
internally with a variety of Android and iOS phones, versions, connectivity
interference, and usage patterns.

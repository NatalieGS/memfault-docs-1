## Understanding Connectivity at Scale Using Metrics

Debugging connectivity issues are notoriously difficult.

For example, below is a diagram of many of the Bluetooth connection states that
a device can be in. It would be wise to try and track the amount of time that
the device is in all of these states to see where devices are spending most of
their time and likely power.

We recommend tracking the following metrics to help diagnose connectivity
issues:

- Min, Max, Average, and Current Signal Strength (RSSI)
- Radio Channel
- Total number of connects, disconnects, and reconnects
- Total number of connect failures
- Total number of bytes Received & Transmitted (RX/TX)
- Time in "connecting" state
- Time in "connected" state
- Time radio is powered on

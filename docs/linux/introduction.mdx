Memfault is a full device monitoring solution which can be integrated into any
embedded Linux-based device.

Memfault's support for embedded Linux devices is a work-in-progress.

OTA / Release Management is currently fully supported through an off-the-shelve
integration with the SWUpdate agent. Read more about it in the
[OTA / Release Management guide](linux/linux-releases-integration-guide.mdx).

For other Memfault features, such as
[Reboot Reason Tracking](/docs/mcu/reboot-reason-tracking),
[Device Metrics](/docs/mcu/metrics-api),
[Error Tracking with Trace Events](/docs/mcu/trace-events), and
[Coredumps](/docs/mcu/coredumps), we will provide a dedicated embedded Linux SDK
in the near future.

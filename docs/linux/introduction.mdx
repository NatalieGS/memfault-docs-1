Ship hardware products at the speed of software. With Memfault, you can
continuously monitor devices, debug firmware issues, and deploy OTA updates to
your fleet.

## Overview

The Memfault Linux SDK consists of a combination of existing open-source
software and a daemon [`memfaultd`][source-memfaultd] that orchestrates and
configures it. It also implements additional features such as tracking of reboot
reason tracking, and in the future reporting crashes and logs.

To provide core Memfault platform features, the Memfault Linux SDK relies on
well-established, battle-tested open-source software. The daemon `memfaultd`
implements Memfault-specific features and also acts as a configuration agent.

## Prerequisites

Even though support for a broader diversity of setups is planned, this first
versions of our SDK makes the following assumptions:

- Your project uses [Yocto][yocto-homepage] as a build system.
- It uses [`systemd`][systemd-homepage] as an init system.
- It uses [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] for OTA (optional if you don't plan to
  integrate with OTA).
- It uses [collectd][collectd-homepage] for metrics (optional if you don't plan
  to integrate with Metrics).

If your project diverges from these assumptions, please [get in
touch][get-in-touch]. It will likely still work without major changes.

## Getting Started

Take a look at our [getting-started guide][docs-linux-getting-started] to set up
your integration.

## Documentation and Features

- Detailed documentation for the Memfault Linux SDK can be found in our online
  docs: see the [getting-started guide][docs-linux-getting-started].
- Visit our [features overview][docs-platform] for a generic introduction to all
  the major features of the Memfault platform.

[docs-platform]: /docs/platform/introduction/
[docs-linux-introduction]: /docs/linux/introduction
[docs-linux-getting-started]: /docs/linux/linux-getting-started-guide

An integration example can be found under
[`/meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example]. The central part of the SDK
lives in a Yocto layer in [`/meta-memfault`][source-meta-memfault].

### OTA Updates

To provide [OTA Updates][docs-ota], the Memfault Cloud implements an API
endpoint compatible with the [hawkBit DDI API][hawkbit-ddi]. Various clients are
available, but `memfaultd` supports [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] out of the box
and is able to configure it to talk to our hawkBit DDI-compatible endpoint.

[hawkbit-ddi]: https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/
[swupdate-homepage]: https://swupdate.org/

### Metrics

Use [metrics and diagnostic data][docs-metrics] to measure the success of
software updates (OTA) and to proactively diagnose anomalies before users even
experience their effect. The SDK ships with a configurable set of plugins for
[`collectd`][collectd-homepage] to obtain standard KPIs at the operating system
level (e.g. available storage or RAM, CPU utilization, or network status and
traffic). You can also use the SDK to collect product-specific custom metrics
via [`statsd`][statsd-homepage].

### Crash Reports

[Collect coredumps][docs-coredumps] and automatically upload them to the
Memfault platform. Use Memfault's rich backtrace and trace analysis view in
order to debug issues and keep your fleet's crashes under control. Make use of
Memfault's deduplication features as well as advanced [Issue management and
monitoring][docs-issue-management].

### Reboot Reason Tracking

These features are fully in the domain of `memfaultd`.

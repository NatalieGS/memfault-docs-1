This tutorial covers how to manage your embedded Linux over-the-air update flow
with Memfault!

## Terminology Overview

Please refer to [Over-the-Air Updates(OTA)](/docs/platform/ota) for an
introduction to Memfault's OTA concepts and terminology. The paragraphs below
discuss the platform-specific aspects for Embedded Linux.

### Identifying a Device

For a device in a Project, several pieces of identifying information are
tracked.

- Device ID: a unique identifier of a device (often the device serial number).
  For example, this may be a serial number written into the EEPROM of your
  product in the factory or a chip identifier present in the silicon of the main
  MCU on your platform. This identifier _must_ be unique for every device in the
  same Project.
- Hardware Version: for a given device, the revision of hardware present. For
  example, this can be used to represent the different stages of
  [manufacturing builds](https://mflt.io/hardware-engineer-speak) (`evt`, `dvt`,
  `pvt`, ...).

:::note

For any given device, neither of these pieces of information should ever change.

## Getting Started

### Memfault CLI Tool

Releases can be managed either from the Memfault web UI or via the
[memfault cli tool](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli). In
this tutorial we will make use of the CLI client which can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip3 install memfault-cli
```

### User API Key

This is an auth token that can be used as the "password" to make Memfault API
requests which require Basic Authentication.

To locate the token, hover over your name in the top right of the dashboard and
select "My Profile". Copy/paste the token in the "User API Key" section.

This API key should be passed in as the `--password` parameter when using the
Memfault CLI.

#### Project & Organization Slug

When using email & API key authentication, the Memfault CLI tool also needs to
know what organization and project to target. To find the "slugs" of the
organization and project in the Memfault UI:

1. Make sure that you've selected the right project on the top-left
2. Click on "Settings" and then "General Settings"

### Project Key

This is a token that is used when pushing data between a device and the Memfault
cloud. We will be using this to query for OTA Payloads in this tutorial. To
locate this token you will also want to navigate to the "Settings" -> "General"
page in the Memfault UI and copy/paste the token in the "Project Key" section.

## Managing Your First Release

### Create an OTA Payload

<LinuxOtaOptionsTabs>
  <TabItem value="swupdate">

SWUpdate expects OTA Payloads in its own `.swu` format. Read [documentation on
SWUpdate][3] to learn how to create `.swu` files for yor project.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="custom">

Any type of OTA Payload is supported by Memfault. It is the duty of your
firmware to install the OTA Payload on the device.

  </TabItem>
</LinuxOtaOptionsTabs>

### Create Release

In the commands below, please replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE}` with the Software
Type this Release contains. For example, in case of a BeagleBone Black we may
give a Software Type of `bbb-fw`.

Replace `${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION}` with the Hardware Version that this Release
targets. For example, when targeting the "Mass Production" hardware build, we
might use a Hardware Version of `mp`.

Likewise, replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION}` with the Software Version that this
Release contains. For example, in case we're releasing our first cut of our
0.0.1 build, we might use `0.0.1-alpha` as Software Version.

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault --org-token ${YOUR_ORG_TOKEN} \
  --org ${YOUR_ORG_SLUG} \
  --project ${YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG} \
  upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/bbb-fw.swu

INFO: build/bbb-fw.swu: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

We've uploaded `build/bbb-fw.swu` as the OTA Payload. In this example, we're
using a SWUpdate update image (`.swu`), but Memfault supports any type of OTA
Payload.

:::note Tip

If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN=<Organization Token>
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=<Organization slug>
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=<Project slug>
```

With these changes, our invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/bbb-fw.swu

INFO: build/bbb-fw.swu: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

:::

### Activate the Release

Now let's activate the Release in the `default` Cohort.

:::note

Any new device seen that has not explicitly been assigned to a custom cohort
will be part of the `default` cohort. To pre-create devices assigned to a
specific cohort check out our [api-docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/).

:::

In the application, navigate to **Fleet** -> **Cohorts**. Click on the picker
under next to the `default` cohort under "Target Release", select the Release to
activate and you will be prompted with options that can be performed for the
Release.

### Query for OTA Payload

Now that we have a release uploaded and published let's walk through the steps
to download the Release on a device!

<LinuxOtaOptionsTabs>
  <TabItem value="swupdate">

Memfault supports [SWUpdate][3] as a way to update the software on an Embedded
Linux device using its [Suricatta][4] daemon in [general-purpose HTTP server
mode][5].

Suricatta is a daemon mode of SWUpdate that runs on a device and polls a remote
server for updates, downloads them, and installs them. It then reboots the
system with updated software.

#### Building SWUpdate to include Suricatta in general-purpose HTTP server mode

Find the following options, either via `menuconfig` or by modifying `defconfig`:

- `CONFIG_SURICATTA=y`: configures SWUpdate to include the Suricatta daemon in
  the build.
- `CONFIG_SURICATTA_GENERAL=y`: configures Suricatta to use general-purpose HTTP
  server mode.
- Unset `CONFIG_SURICATTA_HAWKBIT`: SWUpdate works either in general-purpose
  HTTP server mode or in Hawkbit mode. Disable Hawkbit support.

#### Configuring the Suricatta on-device daemon to use Memfault

Three sections are required in the configuration file:

- `globals`: contains general settings for SWUpdate that are required for the
  daemon to start. In the example below, we've configured SWUpdate to output
  plenty of logs. You may want to tone this down for a production build.
- `gservice`: through which Suricatta's general-purpose HTTP server mode is
  configured.
- `identify`: is used to uniquely identify the device in Memfault servers, and
  to decide whether the device is eligible for an update.

The following configuration can be used as a starter. Save it in `swupdate.cfg`
and remember to replace all the placeholders with valid values for your project
and device:

```libconfig
globals:
{
        verbose = true;
        loglevel = 6;
        syslog = true;
}

gservice =
{
        url = "https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/swupdate/update";
        logurl = "https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/swupdate/logs?mpk=$YOUR_PROJECT_KEY&id=$DEVICE_SERIAL&v=$SOFTWARE_VERSION&st=$SOFTWARE_TYPE&hw=$HARDWARE_VERSION";
        logevent: (
                {event = "check"; format="#1,date,fw"},
                {event = "started"; format="#2,date,fw"},
                {event = "success"; format="#3,date,fw"},
                {event = "fail"; format="#4,date,fw"}
        );
}

identify : (
        { name = "mpk"; value = "$YOUR_PROJECT_KEY" },
        { name = "id"; value = "$DEVICE_SERIAL" },
        { name = "v"; value = "$SOFTWARE_VERSION" },
        { name = "st"; value = "$SOFTWARE_TYPE" },
        { name = "hw"; value = "$HARDWARE_VERSION" }
);
```

:::note

When SWUpdate downloads and applies your update, it will _not_ automatically
update the `$SOFTWARE_VERSION` in this file. It is the responsibility of your
setup to do this.

:::

#### Example SWUpdate invocation

`swupdate -f /etc/swupdate.cfg -u "--polldelay $(shuf --input-range=14400-21600 --head-count=1)"`

Assuming you've stored `swupdate.cfg` in `/etc/swupdate.cfg`, this command will
start SWUpdate in Suricatta daemon mode and configure the daemon to poll
Memfault servers every periodically at a random interval of between 14400 and
21600 seconds (4 to 6 hours).

#### Integration with Yocto

The [`meta-memfault-swupdate-example`][6] Yocto layer is based on [SWUpdate
documentation on building with Yocto][7] and should serve as an example of
building your own Linux image that contains SWUpdate preconfigured to work with
Memfault.

We have prepared [a `Dockerfile`][8] that serves as an example of using
`meta-memfault-swupdate-example` as part of a Poky build. Read more about
`meta-memfault-swupdate-example` in [the project `README`][6].

  <TabItem value="custom">

To receive an OTA Payload, a device will need to pass these REST API query
parameters:

- `device_serial` - This is used for determining the `cohort` a Device is in.
- `hardware_version` - To identify the board revision of the device for
  situations when the device has not been seen before.
- `software_type` - The software component on the device responsible for
  performing OTA updates.
- `current_version` - The current `software_version` of the `software_type` that
  performs OTA updates. This is used to determine if there is a newer
  `software_version` available to be installed.

We can test this out from our computer to see the exact response a device will
see. Let's assume we have the following test device:

- `hardware_version`: mp
- `software_type`: bbb-fw
- `current_version`: 0.0.1
- `device_serial`: DEMOSERIAL

#### Example Response when Newer OTA Payload Available

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_LATEST_API_ROUTE=https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest
$ export SOFTWARE_VERSION=0.0.1
$ curl -i -X GET \
  "${MEMFAULT_LATEST_API_ROUTE}?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=mp&software_type=bbb-fw&current_version=${SOFTWARE_VERSION}" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

content-type: application/json

{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      [...]
      "url": "URL_FOR_OTA_PAYLOAD"
    }
  ],
}

```

When a new payload has been found, you will get a HTTP response with a 200
status code.

If there are no updates available (such as when the device is already on the
newest firmware) you will see a 204 (No Content) http status code in the
response. We can try it out by retrying the query with `0.0.1` as the value for
`current_version`:

#### Example Response when Device is Up To Date

```bash
$ export SOFTWARE_VERSION=0.0.1
$ curl -i -X GET  \
  "${MEMFAULT_LATEST_URL_API_ROUTE}?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=mp&software_type=bbb-fw&current_version=0.0.1" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"

HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
memfault-reason: latest
[...]
```

### Rollback Release

Aborting or Rolling back from a Release which has a firmware regression is easy
to do from the UI. Simply navigate to "Fleet" -> "Cohorts", click on the picker
under "Options" and select the "Abort Rollout" option.

Memfault's Embedded Linux Over-the-Air updates (OTA) solution is hawkBit Direct
Device Integration (DDI) API compatible. For information on Linux OTA, please
see [Embedded Linux OTA Integration Guide][memfault-linux-ota-guide].

For general information about Memfault OTA, including all the features
available, please see our [OTA Update docs][memfault-release-management-ui].

This page is aimed at users who are already familiar with the [hawkBit DDI
API][hawkbit-ddi-api] and [Management UI][hawkbit-management-ui].

## Differences between hawkBit and Memfault

For migrations to Memfault, hawkBit Clients on the device remain unchanged but
need to be configured to point to Memfault;
[Memfault acts as a hawkBit update server](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide#query-for-ota-payload)
by implementing the [hawkBit DDI API][hawkbit-ddi-api].

Users leverage the [Memfault Web Application][memfault-release-management-ui] as
a replacement of the [hawkBit Management UI][hawkbit-management-ui].

Memfault does not implement the [hawkBit Management
API][hawkbit-management-api]; for headless OTA management, one should exercise
the [Memfault Releases API][memfault-linux-ota-guide].

Memfault relies on the [Gateway Security Token
Authentication][hawkbit-ddi-api-security-token-auth] system as defined by
hawkBit.

Here is an overview of hawkBit concepts and how they map to Memfault:

## Comparing Memfault to hawkBit's Management UI

Using Memfault's OTA features allows you to manage releases through the Memfault
interface. Let's look at a comparison between the
[hawkBit management UI](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/) and Memfault. The
goal of this section is to visually connect hawkBit's management UI and Memfault
concepts. If you're familiar with navigating hawkBit you'll be able to find the
equivalent fleet data in Memfault.

According to the hawkBit docs:

> The hawkBit Management UI provides several views for the different use cases:

> - Deployment Management view for target administration and manual deployment.
> - Distribution Management view software repository metadata management.
> - Artifact Management view to manage the artifacts.
> - Target Filter Management view to manage target filters that can be used both
>   in Deployment and Rollout Management views.
> - Rollout Management for large scale rollout orchestration.

:::warning

Some data may not exist because Memfault doesn't have every hawkBit feature
implemented yet.

### System Configuration

hawkBit provisions important things including authentication tokens in the
System Config view.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-system-config.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-system-config.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault project-level settings operate as hawkBit's system config data model.
Notably, every device requires an auth token for receiving updates from
Memfault. You can find the `Project Key` which acts like hawkBit's Gateway Token
under Memfault's `Settings` tab. Provide the token in each device configuration.
Create multiple projects for a multi-tenant approach. Each project is considered
a different tenant.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-settings.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-settings.png"
  />
</p>

### Deployment Management

The hawkBit management UI combines some device and release information in a
single view.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-deployment-mgmt.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-deployment-mgmt.png"
  />
</p>

In Memfault, navigate to `Fleet/Devices` to see your devices, similar to the
Targets column hawkBit provides with more information density. You can view the
current software version of every device in your fleet.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-devices.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-devices.png"
  />
</p>

We can do better. Devices are managed in **Cohorts**, which are logical groups
of devices. Cohorts are similar to hawkBit Target Filters. Navigate to
`Fleet/Cohorts`. A `default` cohort is available for every new project. You can
also create your own cohorts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-cohorts.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-cohorts.png"
  />
</p>

Click on any cohort and you'll find a version matrix, distribution, and settings
for cohort management. Version management tracks different versions deployed
within a cohort.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-default-cohort.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-default-cohort.png"
  />
</p>

The distribution tab in a Memfault cohort shows the breakdown of software
versions deployed across the cohort.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-cohort-distribution.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-cohort-distribution.png"
  />
</p>

### Distribution Management

hawkBit Distributions provide high-level information about releases.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-distribution-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-distribution-management.png"
  />
</p>

The Memfault equivalent of a hawkBit Distribution is a **Release**. Releases are
found under `Software/OTA Releases` on the sidebar.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-releases.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-releases.png"
  />
</p>

Select a release for more information about it. Keep in mind there's naming
overlap where hawkBit and Memfault concepts don't align. For example the
Memfault details widget isn't meant to exactly match hawkBit's Distribution set
details tab.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release.png"
  />
</p>

### Artifact Management

hawkBit's view for managing Artifacts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-artifact-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-artifact-management.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault stores an **OTA Payload** which is similar to hawkBit Artifacts.
Navigate into `Software/OTA Releases` and select a release. You can add an OTA
Payload through the UI if no OTA Payloads are available.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release-payload.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release-payload.png"
  />
</p>

### Rollout Management

hawkBit has two views for managing Rollouts.

A list of Rollouts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-progress.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-progress.png"
  />
</p>

A single Rollout.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-complete.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-complete.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault uses the term **Release** to describe a deployment of a software
version to devices. Navigate to `Software/OTA Releases` and notice that the page
shows any active releases.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-releases.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-releases.png"
  />
</p>

You can track the progress of a release by clicking on the name. The compact
audit log has visibility into release progress and history.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release-payload.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-ota-release-payload.png"
  />
</p>

If you select a cohort with an active release, the version management tab within
a cohort contains a progress percentage of the release.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-release-progress.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-release-progress.png"
  />
</p>

A **Cohort** distribution tab contains the current deployment.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-release-distribution.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-release-distribution.png"
  />
</p>

### Target Filter Management

hawkBit's view for managing Target Filters.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-target-filter-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-target-filter-management.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault uses Cohorts for managing groups of devices. The `Fleet/Devices` page
has top-level data for observing individual device health.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-devices.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-devices.png"
  />
</p>

Clicking into a device will yield more information.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/memfault-device.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/memfault-device.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault's Embedded Linux Over-the-Air updates (OTA) solution is hawkBit Direct
Device Integration (DDI) API compatible. For information on Linux OTA, please
see [Embedded Linux OTA Integration Guide][memfault-linux-ota-guide].

For general information about Memfault OTA, including all the features
available, please see our [OTA Update docs][memfault-release-management-ui].

This page is aimed at users who are already familiar with the [hawkBit DDI
API][hawkbit-ddi-api] and [Management UI][hawkbit-management-ui].

## Differences between hawkBit and Memfault

For migrations to Memfault, hawkBit Clients on the device remain unchanged but
need to be configured to point to Memfault;
[Memfault acts as a hawkBit update server](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide#query-for-ota-payload)
by implementing the [hawkBit DDI API][hawkbit-ddi-api].

Users leverage the [Memfault Web Application][memfault-release-management-ui] as
a replacement of the [hawkBit Management UI][hawkbit-management-ui].

Memfault does not implement the [hawkBit Management
API][hawkbit-management-api]; for headless OTA management, one should exercise
the [Memfault Releases API][memfault-linux-ota-guide].

Memfault relies on the [Gateway Security Token
Authentication][hawkbit-ddi-api-security-token-auth] system as defined by
hawkBit.

Here is an overview of hawkBit concepts and how they map to Memfault:

## Comparing Memfault to hawkBit's Management UI

Let's compare the [hawkBit management UI](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/)
and Memfault for
[managing OTA updates](/docs/platform/ota/#managing-ota-updates-with-memfault).
The goal of this section is to help transition from using hawkBit to Memfault.
If you're familiar with navigating hawkBit you'll be able to find the equivalent
fleet data in Memfault.

:::warning

Not all hawkBit concepts have a corresponding Memfault counterpart.

:::

### System Configuration

hawkBit provisions important things including authentication tokens in the
System Config view.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-system-config.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-system-config.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault project-level settings operate as hawkBit's system config data model.
Notably, every device requires an auth token for receiving updates from
Memfault. You can find the
[Project Key](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide/#project-key) which
functions like hawkBit's Gateway Token under Memfault's
[`Settings`](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings) tab.
Provide the token in each device configuration. Create multiple projects for a
multi-tenant approach. Each project is considered a different tenant.

:::info

Using a Gateway Token is the only authentication method Memfault supports right
now.

:::

### Deployment Management

The hawkBit management UI combines some device and release information in a
single view.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-deployment-mgmt.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-deployment-mgmt.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault displays device and release data differently. Navigate to
[`Fleet/Devices`](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/devices)
to see your devices. You can learn more about
[organizing and managing devices](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#organizing-devices-within-a-project)
in the Memfault docs.

Click on any [cohort](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#cohorts) and you'll
find [version management](/docs/platform/ota/#cohort-version-management) options
available.

Unlike hawkBit, the distribution tab in a
[cohort view](/docs/platform/ota/#cohorts-view) shows the breakdown of
[software versions](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version/#software-version)
deployed across those devices.

### Distribution Management

hawkBit Distributions provide high-level information about releases.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-distribution-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-distribution-management.png"
  />
</p>

The Memfault equivalent of a hawkBit Distribution is a
[release](/docs/platform/ota/#release-types).
[OTA Releases](/docs/platform/ota/#ota-releases) will guide you through finding
releases.

:::warning

There's naming overlap where hawkBit and Memfault concepts don't align. For
example the Memfault details widget isn't meant to exactly match hawkBit's
Distribution set details tab.

:::

### Artifact Management

hawkBit's view for managing Artifacts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-artifact-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-artifact-management.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault stores and distributes
[OTA Payload's](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide/#create-an-ota-payload)
to devices.

:::warning

Memfault doesn't support multiple OTA payloads per release.

:::

### Rollout Management

hawkBit has two views for managing Rollouts.

A list of Rollouts.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-progress.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-progress.png"
  />
</p>

A single Rollout.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-complete.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-rollout-management-complete.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault implements a [Staged Rollout](/docs/platform/ota/#activating-a-release)
to describe a deployment of a software version to devices. Unlike hawkBit, all
rollouts are anchored around a
[cohort](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#cohorts). Navigate to
[`Software/OTA Releases`](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/releases)
and notice that the page shows any active releases.

### Target Filter Management

hawkBit's view for managing Target Filters.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="900"
    src="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-target-filter-management.png"
    alt="/img/docs/linux/hawkbit-ui-target-filter-management.png"
  />
</p>

Memfault uses [cohorts](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#cohorts) for managing
groups of devices. The
[`Fleet/Devices`](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/devices)
page has a comprehensive
[device search](/docs/platform/metrics/#searching-devices-by-attributes-and-timeseries)
available which can filter devices on complex dimensions unavailable in hawkBit.

Memfault's Embedded Linux OTA solution is hawkBit API compatable. For
information on Linux OTA, please see
[Embedded Linux OTA Integration Guide](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide).

This page is aimed at users who are already familiar with the hawkBit API and
UI. We demonstrate the differences between Memfault and hawkBit.

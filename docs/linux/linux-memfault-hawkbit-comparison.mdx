Memfault's Embedded Linux Over-the-Air updates (OTA) solution is hawkBit Direct
Device Integration (DDI) API compatable. For information on Linux OTA, please
see
[Embedded Linux OTA Integration Guide](/docs/linux/linux-releases-integration-guide).

For general information about Memfault OTA, including all the features
available, please see our [OTA Update docs](/docs/platform/ota).

This page is aimed at users who are already familiar with the
[hawkBit DDI API](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/) and
[Management UI](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/ui/). We demonstrate the
differences between Memfault and hawkBit.

## Differences between the platforms

For migrations to Memfault, hawkBit Clients on the device remain unchanged but
need to be configured to point to Memfault; Memfault acts as a hawkBit update
server by implementing the hawkBit DDI API.

Users leverage the Memfault Web Application as a replacement of the hawkBit
Management UI.

Memfault does not implement the hawkBit Management API; for headless OTA
management, one should exercise the
[Memfault Releases API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?__hstc=76629258.1d46e440b11097fd49358ba7ed143381.1651010291525.1651010291525.1651092778738.2&__hssc=76629258.3.1651092778738&__hsfp=2826783498#8f4664ba-92cf-4b9d-bf07-89bfdacf11d4).
